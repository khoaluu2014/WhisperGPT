Hello and welcome to History22. Before we get going, I would like to remind you to check out the introductory video to the course. The link to the video is in the syllabus. And I basically walk you through, you know, if you haven't watched it already, you may want to do so now. I walk you through all the basic things that you need to know about this course. Take you through the syllabus, important dates, things you should know, basically sort of step one.
For anything that you need to be aware of before we start diving deep into the content. If you have any questions, of course, feel free to email me anytime. I usually reply rather quickly, maximum a day, absolute maximum, let's say 48 hours, but more likely than not a lot less than that. So, you know, if any problem just shoot me a message. One more thing that you should keep in mind is that there are a lot of questions.
There are power points available on the course website. So when you listen to these lectures, it may not be a bad idea to have access to the power points so that if I say some term that you're not understanding or maybe the spelling, it seems rather mysterious to you. Most of the key terms are up there on the power points on the course website. So as you listen to what I'm going to be lecturing on, you can refer to the power point and read the actual keywords up there.
It may help you along as you listen. So without further ado, let's jump into the material. I think probably a good place to start would be with a couple of things regarding terminology. In the course of the semester, you're going to be hearing me use words more or less interchangeably. I'm going to be using American, Native American, Indigenous people, First Nations. I mentioned this in the introductory video.
But it's worth re-emphasizing it here. The reality is none of these words are technically precise because they are, they are attempts to generalize about a common identity for all native people of this continent.
And the reality is that pretty much everybody, nobody saw themselves as native or American Indian or wherever else you want to define it back in 1492 or even in the 1600s or probably even much later.
People identify with a specific community. You were happy or you were Lakota or you were something from a specific tribal community.
This idea of a common native identity really doesn't come into being until much, much later.
So any of these words are inevitably they overgeneralize. They imply a common identity that really wasn't there in the beginning.
But since now it may be useful sometimes to not just get lost in all the details of the history of each tribe but generalize some points about the native experience as a whole.
Any one of these words more or less work as well as the next one. Some people prefer some words over other.
But more or less none of these terms are, I mean, take even like the most common term that's often discounted, the term Indian.
There are two obvious problems with the word Indian. One, it's a geographical mistake. Columbus landed in the Caribbean thinking that he was arriving in India, started using the word Indians, obviously geographically wrong.
And the other problem is that it forces this common identity on tribal communities that were very, very different from one another.
You know, when you look at the incredible range of cultures, languages, beliefs, ways of making a living that different tribes had and some cases still have,
you can begin to see why overgeneralizing may be a problem.
But having said that, the word Indian in itself is not a racist term, it's just a less than precise term.
And since we need to use something to generalize about native people as a whole, many people are sort of indifferent.
And by many people, I mean, many native people are kind of indifferent to whether you're using American Indian or native American or indigenous peoples or First Nations as is common in Canada.
Some people prefer one over the other, but the reality is that the majority of people are okay with any of them.
Terms on the other end that are obviously racist in nature are obviously not okay.
Even when you start seeing things like primitive versus civilized, well, that's not just a neutral term, there's a value judgment attached to it.
So those we leave at the curb, but terms like native American or American Indian, we'll use them more or less interchangeably throughout the course.
With this in mind, let's get the ball rolling regarding the very origins of native history.
We're going to be looking at...
There's kind of an argument there, right off the bat regarding where did native Americans originate?
How long have native Americans been in this continent?
And typically each tribe has its own origin story for how they came into being.
Western historians tend to dismiss these stories as myths.
They consider them kind of like an Adam and Eve type of thing.
Cool origin story, but that's not a real history.
And of course that creates a bit of tension between the two sides.
What historians tend to go by is what's known as the Bering Strait Theory.
The Bering Strait Theory in its most simplified version is the notion that human beings came into the Americas from Asia
during the Ice Age, during at a time when so much of the water that exists in the water today was trapped in ice form.
And so back then the two continents, Asia versus North America, they weren't two separate continents.
They were united by these humongous landmass of frozen water, essentially ice, that connected the two continents at the very top.
And so the standard theory went that people from East Asia walk their way into North America spread southward
and that's how you end up having a native American population.
There's a little evidence about this stuff, but as we're going to see this theory has been revised a bunch of times.
So not only do native Americans don't embrace it because they tend to clash with their own origin stories.
And their origin stories usually place them in this continent for the entire time.
They were in the Americas from day one.
But the other problem is the evidence, the actual historical evidence for the Bering Strait Theory is a little on shaky legs.
Some stuff is undeniable.
So let's start with the strong stuff.
There is DNA evidence suggesting that some East Asia population are likely the ancestors of native Americans.
That there's a very strong genetic similarity.
Not only in terms of DNA, but also if you look at certain physical features, there are some dental features,
which may sound weird because to me a tooth is a tooth.
I don't really get that.
But for people who study this stuff or dentists, apparently there are some markers on the teeth that are unique among East Asia people
and among Native Americans that are not found anywhere else in the world.
So there is something to it.
People did move.
There is some contact between East Asia and the Americas.
The other piece of evidence used is that in the Americas there is no evidence for any of the ancestral species to human beings.
There are no Neanderthal finds.
There's no archaic Homo sapiens.
The only human-like bones that you find in the Americas belong to fully formed modern humans, to Homo sapiens sapiens.
What that means is that humans evolved somewhere else and then came to the Americas somewhat more recent times
after they were already Homo sapiens sapiens.
This is nice, but that really is pretty much all the evidence we have for the Berenstre theory.
So it's not exactly...
It's solid, but not super solid. There are some pieces missing.
Let's start with one of the problems that if you think...
If you imagine that this is what happened, that the ancestors of Native peoples walked their way from Asia into the Americas,
then it would make sense to figure out that the older sites would be up in Alaska.
And then as they spread southward, you find progressively more and more recent sites.
So let's look at some dates, because that's going to throw a bit of a wrench in the whole Berenstre theory thing.
Now, keep in mind that the date that I'm going to be giving you guys now is the most conservative date.
That today even the most conservative historians would agree with.
This is for our long-lived Native people being in the Americas,
and the date that's currently accepted by pretty much everybody
is that the ancestors of Native peoples have been for at least 13,000 years.
13,000.
That's just the bare minimum accepted date for Native presence in the Americas.
Some people argue that this date is incorrect, that the ancestors of Native people have been here for a lot longer than this.
I'll give you an example for why... how is it even possible for different archaeologists to argue on this point?
You know, you get one archaeologist who will come along, will find maybe evidence from a fire during an archaeological dig.
They find, hey, somebody made a fire here.
They see a few rocks placed around the central area where the fire was made.
So they figure, okay, the rocks indicated somebody made a fire ring.
The Berenst charcoal indicates fire.
They do radiocarbon dating on the charcoal.
The date come back to, I don't know, 25,000 years ago.
And so they say clearly Native people were here 25,000 years ago.
Another archaeologist will come around, look at the exact same evidence and say, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not what's going on here.
What you are seeing is a fire, yes, and it is from 25,000 years ago.
But, no, it's not man-made.
Fire could have been started by lightning.
And what you call a fire ring, eh, those are a few rocks, a raffling, a circular shape.
That's not a fire ring.
Those are a bunch of rocks that could have happened to be there for other reasons.
It could be a natural or current formation.
So, no, I don't buy these as evidence.
You know, some evidence you can't argue with.
If you find the skeleton of a human being that dates back from 13,000 years ago, well, that settles it.
If you find the rib of a buffalo with an arrowhead stuck in it and you can date it from a certain time,
well, nobody can argue with that because you know that no buffalo was shooting himself with an arrow, right?
Of course, human beings must have been there.
But some of the older evidence gets controversial.
So even though there's a lot and it's likely that people were here longer than 13,000 years,
about 13 give or take a few hundred years is the common agreement, the current leg system on all historians,
that that's the bare minimum.
It may be a lot longer, but that's the bare minimum.
Keep in mind that this date has been pushed progressively further back in time.
We teach archaeological finding.
So it's already a revised date compared to what you find in books that maybe were published 100 years ago.
By the way, there's a kind of a political side to this debate regarding how long native people have been here.
Now, in some way, this doesn't make any sense to me because the whole issue is it's undisputed that the Native Americans were here first.
So of course, this was their land.
It's a done deal.
But generally speaking, one of the things you'll notice is that people were native themselves or sympathetic to Indian interest.
They tend to accept much older dates than people were not so sympathetic to Indian interest.
Those guys tend to reject all evidence other than completely undeniable evidence.
So why would that be?
Why would it be that depending on your sympathy to native causes, you are more or less likely to accept older dates or reject them?
And it really boils down to the notion of right to the land.
The idea that the longer native people have been here, the stronger their claim to the land is.
And vice versa.
If they haven't, if you can prove that they haven't been here as long, you can try to say, well, their claim to the land is not quite as strong.
As I said a minute ago, I think this is done because the reality is they were here first.
Nobody's arguing that Columbus beat them to it.
They were here before.
So they had all the right to the land that is, you know, they lived here.
This was their land.
So whether they were here five minutes before Columbus or 50,000 years is almost irrelevant because they were here anyway.
But just so you know, this is how people argue on this topic, very much along ideological lines.
One more thing I want to tell you about this timeframe business, the 13,000 years is that,
personally, I feel it's almost certainly incorrect.
Well, one of two things.
Either the date is incorrect or the Berenstre theory as it has commonly been exposed is incorrect.
Here is the problem.
As I was telling you earlier, if the Berenstre theory is correct, you would expect sites up in Alaska to be much older than the sites you find in South America.
Because, you know, it wasn't a contest where they all got together in Siberia one day and say,
let's see who can make it to the bottom of Chile first.
You know, migration would have been a very slow, very slow moving process that would have taken centuries.
And yet that's not what we see in the archaeological record.
We do find sites in the bottom of Chile who are as old or older than some of the sites in North America.
And that kind of does not fit this idea of movement north to south by walking when the ice age started coming to an end and some space was opening up along the glaciers.
So there are a couple of theories for how to solve this.
Well, one obvious one is that the date is wrong, that we simply haven't found older sites in North America, but they exist.
And 13,000 years is just the wrong date.
The other option, and by the way, the two options are not exclusive.
They can probably mix together.
The other thing is that migration probably did not happen on foot.
The majority of the migration may have happened by boat.
Keep in mind that the coast of Asia and the coast of the Americas, they were much closer to one another because during the ice age so much of the ocean, the water was trapped in ice form.
So the coastline extended a lot further.
And what some archaeologists are suggesting is that it's very likely that some people may have climbed in boats thousands of years ago.
They have made their way from Asia into North America by following the coastline.
And so you don't see so much evidence of campsites they left behind, a because much of their movement was by boat, and b because
now that evidence would be under water.
If they were making camp along the coastline for the most part, that means that the coastlines is now, whatever many miles is out into the ocean, it melted, it's no longer there.
So all that evidence is gone, and there's no way to get it back.
So that would make a little more sense as far as how migration took place, why we don't find older settlements in North America and all of that.
So that's a little bit just to kind of catch you up on the notion of the debate regarding the origins of native peoples.
Of course, you know, it's one of those impossible debates to fully settle because, you know, there are obviously no written sources.
Nobody was writing books back then.
The best we can do is rely on some archaeology, which is by definition not the most precise thing to reconstruct history in details.
It's something and it's really all we have.
You know, this just sets up what some of the arguments regarding the origins of native peoples are.
With that in mind, we can jump in the very next topic.
The next one is, okay, now that we have established that native people have been here for at least 13,000 years, possibly longer.
Probably coming from Asia, probably by boat, mainly and some by foot.
Let's go into what their life looked like for the first few thousand years.
And again, we have no written sources and we have so little archaeologically.
However, we do have a few things.
We do know that the ancestors of everyone on earth at this time, they were hunting and gathering people.
People who made a living by hunting animals and gathering plants.
And we also know something about hunting and gathering people, both because we can observe the life of hunting and gathering people who are still around today,
as well as references in written sources about the behavior of hunters and gatherers when they encountered literate cultures.
So we can sort of put together a general outlook at what hunting and gathering life entailed.
What did it mean to be a hunter and gatherer 13,000 years ago?
What was life like?
Obviously what I'm about to tell you is it's an extremely generalised portrait of native life.
There's no way to get into specifics because we just don't have that information, but I am able to pay into more generalised framework
that probably apply to a lot of people, maybe not everybody, but lots of people.
There's a YouTube video that I put the link on the syllabus.
Check that one out first, that serves as an introduction to the course.
It will go through the syllabus, it will go through some of the important introductory remarks and that kind of stuff.
So if you haven't done so already, check that one first.
Also keep in mind that as a resource for you, there's a PowerPoint that I've posted online, so check it on the course website
and you'll have access to the PowerPoint in case sometime maybe you want to get some visuals for the stuff we're talking about, the PowerPoint should help.
I mean, say all that, let's get rolling.
Now keep in mind that because this course is the second half of American Indian history, it's just taking up American Indian history from the latter part of the 1800s to the present.
It feels a little bit incomplete to me sometimes because if you guys do both 105 and 106, well that would be a different story.
But there is no requirement in place, so many of you will only take 106, some of you may only take 105.
So the problem is that it's really hard to tell American Indian history starting in the mid-1800s without having any knowledge of what happened before.
So what I usually do in 106 is that I dedicate the beginning to a somewhat quick overview of the kind of material that I would cover in much more detail in the 105 course.
So we will start at the very origin of the debate regarding American Indians.
Our long-ev native people being in this continent and all of that stuff will just do it a lot faster and skimming through a lot more than we would if we were dedicating more time in the 105 course.
So somewhat quickly I will try to catch you up to speed so that even if you never take the 105 course at least you have some basic understanding of what happens in American Indian history before the 1850s or so.
And then once we get to that part of the course we'll slow down a bit and spend more time getting to more details and all of that kind of stuff.
Okay, so having said all that, let's get rolling with the debate regarding the origins of American Indians.
In regards to how long have native people been in this continent, how did they get here and the whole debate, this is a topic that keeps changing.
It's something that history has literally been written in the news because we teach new archaeological discovery, our understanding is changing rather rapidly.
The traditional view the Western historians have pushed is that the ancestors of American Indians came from Asia into the Americas through the Bering Strait.
In case you're wondering what the Bering Strait is, there's a map in the PowerPoint that show you where today Alaska and Asia, specifically what's today Russia, are almost touching but they are separated by a stretch of water.
Well, that's today.
At times in the past during the Ice Age, much of the water was trapped in ice form so people could literally walk their way across from Asia into the Americas.
And traditionally this is what Western historians have argued that it happened.
Many native people disagree with this and they added their own origin stories for how they came into being.
But Western historians usually dismiss that as fairy tales basically, not giving it a whole lot of backing.
The problem is that even the Bering Strait theory, pushed by Western historians, is not necessarily that solid.
The evidence is a bit sketchy for it.
There is something, you know, there is the fact that DNA research tells us that American Indian peoples are closest to East Asians than anyone else.
So clearly there is a connection between East Asians and the ancestors of American Indian peoples.
There's some other physical evidence.
For example, there's some dental evidence indicating that in the shape of some of the teeth.
Now, don't ask me how or why, because I'm not a dentist and none of that makes sense to me at two.
It is a tool, so that's it.
But people who actually study, you know, people who are dentists who are specialists in that thing, they are able to notice some markers in the teeth that are unique to Asian populations and American Indian peoples.
But having said that, that's about all the evidence we have.
You know, maybe you can add the fact that they never found the Americans the bones of ancestral species to Homo sapiens, sapiens.
No Neanderthal, no Homo erectus, none of that stuff, meaning that human beings migrated to the Americas after human evolution had led to Homo sapiens sapiens.
That's about all the evidence we have, which is not a whole lot, to be honest.
And there are also some problems with the timing of it all, because if the Berenstray theory is correct, then you would expect that the oldest sites,
would be found in Alaska.
And then as further and further south you go, they would be progressively more recent.
Because clearly this wasn't a race where they all got together in Siberia one day and said,
hey, let's see who can make it first down to Chile.
You would have been a slow process of migration over centuries.
Well, that's now what we find.
We find the sites at the bottom of South America, which are as old if not older than some of the North American sites.
So something is misinear.
Either native people have been near a lot longer than Western historians believe, and we just haven't found those sites in the North,
or this north to south migration by land is simply not true.
But one of those two things apply.
As far as the timing, the minimum accepted date that even the most conservative Western historian would accept for American Indian presence in this continent is 13,000 years.
13,000 years.
Many people argue this is too conservative, and that native people have been near a lot longer than that.
The problem is that these kind of debates get massive because, you know, archeologically speaking, if you find the bones of a bison with a narrow end stuck in it,
and you can do a radiocarbon date in and come up to 13,000 years ago, well, that's foolproof the human beings were a year hunting 13,000 years ago.
But in other cases, what happens is that the evidence is subject to interpretation.
Let's say you find in an archeological dig you find evidence of a fire,
and you do radiocarbon dating on the charcoal from the fire, and the date comes back to 25,000 years ago.
And you see some rocks around it, so you say, well, this was clearly somebody made a fire pit, burned a fire, human beings were a year 25,000 years ago.
Well, a different archeologist would come along, look at the same evidence and say, yes, I see a fire.
Yes, I see it from 25,000 years ago, but I don't see it as man-made.
This could have been lightning, and what you call a fire ring, it's barely two rocks thrown around. That's not a fire ring.
So, you know, sometimes you have this evidence that's not everybody interpreted the same way.
Bottom line, the 13,000 years date is either too conservative, and native people have been here a lot longer, or there's definitely something wrong with the north to south model of the Berenstre theory.
Keep in mind, by the way, that regarding our long native people have been here, there's a political side to the question, because native people themselves,
and people who are highly sympathetic to native causes, tend to accept the older dates, the older estimates.
People who are not so sympathetic to native interests tend to try to keep the date as close to as possible, and only in the face of overwhelming evidence they are willing to acknowledge older dates.
Why would that be? I mean, who cares? Does it really matter whether natives were here 20,000 years ago or 10,000 years ago?
It really boils down to politics, it boils down to the longer you have been in a continent, the stronger the claim to the land it is, and vice versa, if you want to diminish the claim, you can say that they weren't here that long to begin with.
Now, I find it a little silly, because whether native people were here 5 minutes before Columbus or 50,000 years before Columbus, they were still here first, so there's no argument about whose land it was, but still it's a way to either emphasize it more or diminish that claim, and so that's how white people argue about it to this day.
One more thing regarding this idea of migration from Asia, there's a lot of evidence that's coming up, suggesting that while some people may have come on foot from Asia, the majority may have come by boats and would have migrated along the Pacific coast, and just made camp on the coast, got back into their canoes or their boats, and they were there.
And went back south.
Part of the problem, archeologically speaking, of this idea that people may have come by boats, is that the coastline of North America extended many, many miles into what today is the ocean, at a time of ice age when so much of the water of the oceans was trapped in ice form.
So, the places that would be relevant, archeologically, they may be 300 miles out into the ocean today.
So, it's very hard, next to impossible, to find any archeological remains of the places where people would have camped back then, and that's what makes this all process tricky.
So, yes, very likely that that's what happened based on the available evidence, but not that easy to prove conclusively, because so much of that evidence is long gone and you would be underwater for thousands of years by now.
So, that's as far, that's kind of all I want to tell you about, that debate regarding how long have people been here, where did they come from and all of that stuff.
At least briefly, I want to sketch what life for native peoples was like in the Americas for the first few thousand years.
The one way in which everyone around the world, I don't care whether native or really anywhere else around the world, all human beings, the way we have made a living for the longest time we've been around as being as hunters and gatherers.
It's estimated that 90 plus percent, possibly up to 99 percent of the time we've been around as humans who have been hunters and gatherers.
So, let's look a little bit what, in inevitably generalised terms, because we don't have specific information about which tribe was doing what 13,000 years ago, but let's look a little bit about what hunting and gathering lifestyle entailed.
For one, you hear me talking about hunting and gathering. Those are two separate activities, which generally, across the globe, societies divide up along gender lines.
You usually have men doing the hunting and women doing the gathering.
Which begs the question why, because it's not like women can't hunt, or the men can't gather.
So, why is it that, you know, if you find this kind of difference in one place but not another, well, that could be a cultural thing.
But if across the globe, pretty much everywhere, you find men specialising in hunting and women in gathering, you start thinking that there may be some biological factor a player.
What could it be?
Explanations like, oh, men are physically stronger than women.
Those explanations don't work, because while it's true that generally speaking, most men have greater muscle mass than women.
There are clearly super strong women, there are weak men, there are some grey zones there.
Let's think instead of some differences between males and females that are a little more absurd.
Specifically, one thing that women can do that men can't is have babies.
A give-burt.
You say, well, so what, okay, after the baby is born, a woman could go back to doing their hunting, right?
Well, this is the part where it gets tricky, because before modern times, in order to survive, a human infant needed one thing more than anything else, which was their mother's milk.
You know, a father, they can be the most involved in the world, they can be really present in the child's life.
You know, squeeze all you want, no milk is going to come out of your nipples.
So, the fact that women can breastfeed means that a human baby needs to be close to the mother constantly during their first year or two of life,
and in ancient times, breastfeeding could go on quite a bit.
They don't really need the presence of the father as much.
It's okay if the father is gone on a longer hunting expedition and come back the following week.
It's not okay if the mom is gone on a long hunting expedition because the baby would starve, and if they try to take the baby with them, well, that kind of hunting of big large animals, that's not an activity that's safe enough to drag an infant across.
So, that's basically the reason why men hunt and women gather in this society, is because men can't breastfeed, that's what it boils down to.
As far as tribal size, most, and of course these would vary depending on available resources, but most hunting and gathering bands are anywhere between maybe as little as 10 people as much as 50 people, that's about the standard.
Very rarely you see it going above those numbers.
And by the way, even membership in the tribe kind of changes throughout the year because one characteristic of hunting and gathering societies that they are nomadic.
They don't stay in one place all the time, they move around throughout the season from place to place,
following a seasonal cycle in order to tap into resources that become available at different points in time.
And what does that mean regarding my point on tribal size? Well, during winter, when resources are the most scarce, the band would split, would boil down to the smallest number of people that you can keep together, the basic family unit, just a few people.
In summer when resources are a little more abandoned, this one small group and another small group and another may get together to leave for 2, 3, 4 months together, while the weather is better and resources are more abandoned.
And these kind of gatherings in summer serve multiple functions.
On one level, I'm sure you get bored of seeing the same time faces all the time.
Also you get to trade with one another, you get to exchange knowledge with one another, and more importantly you get to exchange genes with one another.
Because unless you have some strange red-neckish ideas about human sexuality, as a general rule is a really bad idea to pick your mates among people you are related to.
That's by the way, you can be thankful you are in college.
Today you just found out that men can't breastfeed and you shouldn't be having sex with your siblings.
Half of your college education is already done by now, you know the basics, that's what counts.
So moral of the story, you do have the summer gatherings where tribes get together and then they may break apart again in winter before they meet again the following summer.
In terms of politics, hunters and gatherers are the most egalitarian people in the world.
Egalitarian in case you're not familiar with the concept is, it means power and authority are spread more or less evenly in an equal kind of way among all adult members of the group.
It's kind of the opposite of hierarchical.
If you want to think of it the way, think of egalitarian as a sort of a fancy word for equal.
Hunters and gatherers are society where there's minimal if any and hierarchy.
You find very little of it. Leadership is something that you know no tribe of hunters and gatherers they get together and vote or who's going to be the next leader and if you get one more vote you win.
It doesn't work that way.
Their decision making is based on consensus.
You sit around and you talk things out until everybody feels satisfied with a compromise.
Which is a brilliant way to come to decisions is way better than what we do in a democracy where the majority gets to rule and have their way.
The reason why we don't do it today is because they work great in small communities.
When you can sit around the fire and talk things out for hours as the numbers get too big, clearly you can't do that anymore.
But among hunters and gatherers that's how they will come to decisions.
A leader, nobody would be elected leader in a democratic style type of election.
People have been around you your whole life.
They know you as much as you know yourself.
So if they choose you to be a leader it's kind of a natural progression.
It's something that you have proved your word over time.
You have shown that you are really smart, that you give good advice.
So when there's a decision to be made, naturally everyone turns to you to see what you have to say about it.
But as a leader in hunter and gatherers society you have no coercive power.
You can't tell anybody what to do.
You can make suggestions.
Your power is purely based on charisma.
On people liking you.
If you start staying stupid stuff then people stop listening to you.
So leadership is really more based on your personal reputation and charisma than it is on some kind of power that you have as a leader.
If you get to bossing, everybody leave you behind to be the leader of yourself because you're just one knowing.
So that's how they do things.
And similarly along economic lines you don't really see a rich hunter and gathere and a poor hunter and gatherers.
The primary mode among hunters and gatherers is sharing.
These are essentially extended families.
So whatever resource you have you share it with others.
You go out and you kill a deer.
You bring it back and you share the among every member of the tribe.
As long as one person is eating, everybody is eating.
So that's another characteristic of hunting and gatherers lifestyles.
Let me add to these something else that would be applicable to some of the stuff we're going to be looking at later in the semester.
Let's discuss, however, briefly more religious ideas, more spiritual ideas.
We've seen so far structural things like economics, leadership, things like that.
Let's look at the inner world for a second, the world of ideas.
Most tribal religions around the world don't necessarily have a single name.
Scholars have tried to come up with something to group all tribal traditions under one heading.
So sometimes they call it animism, sometimes they call it shamanism, sometimes they just say tribal religions.
However you call it, this kind of worldview is the most ancient form of religion in the world.
A hundred percent of our ancestors practice some form of shamanism or another.
Still to date it's about 10% of people in the world practice it.
The reason for this decline, well there are multiple, but once human beings will move away from being as close to nature as we once were,
new religions that fit urban living better will start developing.
And those religions will have a big impact.
Like for example, think about the two biggest religions in the world in terms of numbers.
Those would be Christianity and Islam.
Think about the religions in the world that have the most wars and bloodshed and conquest in their history.
Well there also would be Christianity and Islam.
Coincidence, not really.
The majority of animistic people or shamanic people, however you want to call it, converted to one of these two religions because they got invaded
and somebody showed up with a big sword and said, if you don't convert I'm going to chop your head off.
And people would say, well I've always wanted to convert your religion, it sounds great.
People don't convert because somebody knock on their door and say, hey listen to this great idea, largely this is a product of conquest.
So that's part of the reason for the decline.
In any case, what does it mean?
What are some of the key concepts of shamanism or animism or however you want to refer to it?
One key idea is that the universe is spiritually alive.
It has everything.
Human beings have a soul, animals have souls,
plants have souls, there are spirits that may not have a body but they exist anyway.
So the whole universe is spiritually alive, it's populated of beings that have a spirit.
This is the exact opposite of what you find in Western religions which push the idea of Anthropocentrism.
Anthropocentrism is basically the notion that human beings are special and they are above all other life forms.
This is really not the way animistic people see it.
They believe that all sorts of creatures in the world have a spiritual essence.
Furthermore, they believe something else too.
If you guys have watched Star Wars, then you know what I'm talking about.
Because basically one of their beliefs is this idea that there is not only there is a spirit inside of everybody,
but that there is literally a force.
Like think of any fact, the coincidences are not, you know, if you watch Star Wars,
a lot of George Lucas ideas do come from animistic beliefs.
That's what inspired a lot of the Star Wars universe.
The belief there is that there's this energy that pervades the whole universe.
And it's not a good energy or a bad energy, it's just energy.
And if you are able to tap into this energy,
you may be able to do seemingly magical things.
You can use it to become a better healer, you can use it to become a better hunter, you can use it to become a better warrior.
You can use it for anything really.
And the idea of this is that the purpose to which you put this energy may have a moral dimension.
You know, much like there's the light side and the dark side of the force, you can do it with this concept.
But the energy itself is just neutral, it's just power.
How you use it may have an impact.
So this notion of, I'll give you an example of this tapping into power.
You know, there's a story, for example, among the Taromara, Taromara, a native population from Northern Mexico.
And up until modern times, members of the Taromara tribe have been able to do this
insanely long run with no breaks.
They would just go out and run for 100 miles.
And then the next day they turn around and they run 100 miles back.
Which is almost superhuman.
It's like how?
You even begin to train the athletes at the end of the marathon or that tired.
How do these guys run 100 miles?
The way the Taromara explain is, yeah, there is, you know, you need to train like an athlete,
you train your muscles, you train your breathing, all of that.
But that by itself is not enough.
You also need to train spiritually.
You do certain rituals, you pray, you do all these things, and then spirits will give you the power.
So that when you run, it's not just your muscle pushing you forward.
There's something that you can do on a more subtle level.
Now, even to a lot of the stuff may sound very outlandish.
You know, it's like, yeah, sure, everybody wants to have magical powers and become a Jedi Knight, but come on.
Well, for hunters and gatherers, this idea is very pragmatic.
There's an empirical dimension to it.
It's like, you can tell as day you had a vision of flying green men giving you powers,
but nobody cares unless you can demonstrate that you have powers.
You know, run 100 miles or have somebody half dead being brought to you and you pray over them and you heal them.
If you can pull it off, then we're listening.
But if you can't, then you're just hallucinating.
That's not a vision that just...
Because that's, by the way, one of the concepts as far as how do you get this power?
So how do you tap into it?
The notion is that spirits will give you this power.
You can just put yourself out there hoping they decide to help you, but this is something that can happen in dreams.
This is something that can happen in visions while you're awake.
But the idea is that spirits may give you some powers and teach you how to use them.
Theoretically speaking, everyone is able to do this kind of stuff.
But their idea is that some people are better at it than others.
You know, I'm sure some of you guys may have had weird experiences where maybe you think of somebody that you haven't seen or thought about in forever
and they just pop in your mind and then a few hours later you run into them and you're like, what are the odds?
This is just crazy.
Now stuff like that happens to pretty much everybody sooner or later,
but we usually just say, whoa, that was crazy and leave it at that because we don't control it.
If we could control it, that would be cool, right?
It could be like Blackjack, Blackjack, Blackjack and use it for something.
But it doesn't work that way.
When it happens, it's an interesting reminder that we live in a weird universe, but we kind of leave it at that.
We don't know.
Hunters and the others believe that some people are better at it than others.
Some people do have a degree of control.
This would be the people who are referred to as sometimes medicine men or medicine woman or in some cultures they use the term shaman
or basically religious specialists who have a higher degree of success when trying to tap into the power compared to normal people.
And much like I mentioned, you don't have to be a nice person to be able to tap into it.
You know, you can be a wonderful sweet shaman or you can be an evil witch.
You know, the power is the same one.
Some people will use it for good.
Some people will not use it for good, but the idea behind it is the same.
If any of it, this sounds really crazy to you.
Well, think that pretty much all religions originate from this.
Even think of something that you may be more familiar with.
Like think about the Jesus story in the Bible.
I remember reading about missionaries visiting a native tribe and beginning to talk with some guy and trying to preach about the gospel,
and the guy got really excited and by the time they were done, he said, I like Jesus.
He sounds great.
He's just like my grandpa.
And the missionaries were like, what?
No.
Didn't you hear us?
It's the miracles, the amazing son of God, blah, blah, blah.
And the guy was like, yep, heard you the first time.
Just like my grandpa.
You know how your guy went off for 40 days in the desert, fasting and praying?
And after this, he started going around and having all these amazing powers.
Well, my grandpa went off on this big vision quest.
He fasted, he prayed, spirits came, gave him the power, he came back, they would bring him.
People were half dead, he would pray over them and they would get better.
Told people to be nice to each other.
You know, Jesus was a good medicine man, good shaman.
You know, the Jesus story is the archetypal shamanic story is what a good shaman does.
It's just that in Christianity, he's seen as the only guy who can do it and is super special.
In a shamanic contest, that's kind of the role of what a shaman does.
In any case, one more scene that I want to explore and this is going to be a big one.
You know, a lot of this information I'm giving you is interesting as background info.
The one concept we're going to be exploring now is really important because it will have a huge impact on the entire history of native European conduct.
Let me take a second to get to the point because it's a complex one, but check this one out.
Basically, it's the difference between inclusive world views and exclusive world views.
Let me explain what that means.
There are two words in the Lakota language, Wokan-tanka that sometimes missionaries have translated as God.
But there's a big difference between the concept of God in a Western sense and the idea of Wokan-tanka among the Lakota.
For one, if you translate Wokan-tanka literally, Wokan means both sacred slash mysterious, Tanka means great.
So a more or less literal translation would be great sacred mystery or great mystery or something like that.
Even if you know nothing about Lakota culture, there's a difference between conceiving of the ultimate reality as a great mystery versus conceiving of it as God in a Western sense.
If you read the Bible or the Quran or any of the Western traditions, God is a character in the story.
It's the most powerful character of all, but God has a personality.
We'll tell you certain things, we'll set some rules, we'll...
There's the idea in Western tradition of revelation that God can reveal his will to human beings and tell them how to live.
The concept of great mystery is not an atheist concept, it's not saying there is no such thing as a God or God, it's saying the greatest stuff in the universe is mysterious, it's beyond human understanding, it's there, it's powerful, it's amazing, but you can never fully put your finger on it.
Why is this important because it leads to tremendously important consequences?
Consider in the West, can you be Christian and Muslim at the same time?
I mean, I guess you can do whatever hell you want, right? As an individual, but officially according to the official doctrine of each religion, no you can't.
Even though they both claim that they hear God's voice, they both claim that God tells them how to live, but they disagree because the content of the message is different.
And if you believe that there's just a single God that's telling you how to live, but you get different messages, well clearly one of us must be wrong.
Unless you're assuming that God is completely schizophrenic, then obviously one of us must have already wrong.
So think how that plays out. This by the way, what I mean by exclusive worldviews means that only one can be right, there's only one right path to the truth, no other.
So if I believe that I have the truth that I receive straight from God and I hear that someone else has a different take on it,
I don't even need to know what the content of their message is because unless it's identical to mine, then they must be wrong because only one of us can be right.
God, one God giving one revelation, there can only be one truth.
So, and not only by the way, the other side may be wrong, the other side also because Western worldviews are very dualistic.
You know, there's God, there's the devil, there's heaven, there's hell, there's...
Then that means that not only you are wrong, you're also on the side of evil.
You know, whether you know it or not, you are a servant of the devil.
So exclusive worldviews basically assume that there's only one through way and all others must be wrong, slash evil.
The opposite is through in inclusive worldviews, which is more where the Lakota concept goes.
If I believe that ultimate reality is mysterious, then whatever I know about it is always a partial truth.
I'm not making a claim to know God's will, at best you make a claim to have gotten a glimpse of the truth.
So if somebody else come around and tell you that they have a different interpretation,
well, difference is not a threat if you don't believe that there's only one truth.
They may also be correct, they may have gotten a different aspect of the truth.
There's no way to tell before testing it out.
So if you run into a different worldview, you check it out, you see what they have to say, you try it out for yourself.
This is why, by the way, not just among American Indians, if you look at China before communism,
people could be dawists, Confucianists and Buddhists at the same time and practice multiple religious traditions at the same time,
because none of them argue that they were the only way.
So you can sort of mix and match.
That's an inclusive worldview, whereas the exclusive worldview sees that as impossible.
If you look at the consequence of these beliefs, the whole history of the West,
there are religious wars one after another, religious violence is the norm.
Among North American Indian tribes, you would be very hard-pressed to find any evidence of so-called the Holy Wars,
where somebody goes to war against another tribe because they hold different beliefs.
That stuff just doesn't happen because you just don't care if somebody is different beliefs.
You know, you'll try them out, you'll see what they have to say, if you like them, great.
Now you add it to your own practice.
If you don't like it, you leave it where it is, but it's no threat to you.
Whereas in the West, you have this history of fighting one another over religion.
Not even between different religions.
I mean, of course you have all the wars between Christians and Muslims or things like that.
But even within the religions, you have Protestant and Catholic, killing each other forever,
sonai and Shi'ai Muslim, killing each other forever, you know, because the idea is the only one can be correct.
I'll shut up about it now because again, I would spend a lot more time in the 105 course on these concepts.
Right now I just want to give you a basic understanding, but for this particular concept, we'll continue to apply to the entire history of native European content.
People of European descent over and over will try to argue that their way is the way,
and so there will be an idea of competition with native religions, the idea that they need to abandon their religions and be converted to Christianity.
Many native people, even when they are intrigued with some aspect of Christianity, will rarely feel the need to give up their own tradition.
They don't see that as in competition.
The idea is if one religion is a good thing, then two, three or four are even better.
But we'll see how some of this works out.
In any case, when we talk about hunters and gatherers living in the Americas for thousands of years,
I like what you see in the movies where the classic image of native people is people living in TPs,
running around on horseback, but there were no horses in the Americas.
Or rather, there used to be horses, but they were never domesticated and then went extinct.
So all travel was either on foot or by canoe.
So the image of native people on horseback, that's a post-conquesting, not an early one.
And not only that, but rarely you see any kind of domesticated animal.
Mainly dogs.
Native people, definitely dogs, which will be used for the hunt, to help you guard.
And also, as you know, you clearly can't ride dogs, I mean you can try, but usually you can't really mad.
But you can use them as beasts of burden.
Now they are not horses, they are not horses, they are not that large, but what you can do is you can lay out the skin of an animal,
put a few objects in it, wrap it up, tie it to the back of the dog.
The dog is trotting along with you and is like having an extra hand.
And when you think about that as hunters and gatherers, all your possessions, you are carrying them on your back all the time,
having a couple of dogs around that can carry even a little bit for you, can go a long way.
So, in terms of animals, beside the ones that human beings domesticated such as dogs,
hunters and gatherers during the early years of American Indian presence here were hunting what's known as megafauna.
Megafauna is a fancy word to mean big freaking animals, like huge ones.
Think something like the woolly mammoth for example, that's something that was hunted by native people.
And woolly mammoths were considerably larger than even modern elephants.
Pretty much all life forms during the Ice Age were larger.
You have beside the animals the human beings hunted, they were the ones that you had to deal with.
So, they were seeing like sebor tooth tigers.
There was something known as the short faced bear, which is almost twice the size of a modern grizzly.
And you figure an animal that big at least must be slow, right?
No, it could run at 40 miles an hour and could smell a drop of blood a mile away.
So, think about what it meant for American Indian hunters and how hard life must have been.
Not only the way you made a living was by using what were essentially were sharp sticks to go hunt a mammoth.
Like that's intimidating enough.
But once you are successful and you do make a kill, then you have to defend it from sebor tooth tiger or short face bears
or other humongous predators who are out to compete with you for the same resources.
So, next time you feel like whining about your life and thinking about how hard it is, well,
I think a lot of people from the past would gladly trade places with you.
So, moral of the story, life was rough.
There's no argument about it.
Human beings who are competing with extremely large animals, including very large predators,
that they had to compete with for resources.
Eventually, the end of the last ice age, which doesn't happen overnight, you know,
it's a slow process that takes century, but the end of the last ice age wipe out the megafauna.
You know, most of the warming up of the climate does not favor these super large animals.
So, most of those go extinct and in their place we find the smaller ones.
Even things like bison today, which is a very large animal, is still smaller than bison during the ice age.
And as the climate warm up, it doesn't warm up evenly all over North America.
It warms up unevenly, so some regions will be better suited for certain resources versus others.
So, that's kind of what happens next.
Now, many history books make it sound like the day human beings figure out how to plant a seed.
They will become farmers because that's such a superior way of making a living, while that's simply not true.
We do know, for example, that about 9,000 years ago, native people in Mexico started planting seeds,
but it wasn't until 5,000 years ago that you find the first evidence of people actually becoming farmers.
What happened initially is that some native people, probably women, since they were the one gathering,
figured out how to plant reproduction work.
Figured out if you plant a seed in the ground and water it, the odds are higher that you're going to have more of those plants that you like.
But they are not going to stop in hunters and gatherers.
They may just take a couple of days to plant seed and scatter them and take care of them,
but they are not going to be there guarding it.
They are just going to go along their seasonal cycle, hoping that the next time they come around,
there will be more of those plants that they like.
That's it.
So you can domesticate plants and still remain a hunter and gatherers.
It's really only under very particular circumstances that people will give up the hunting and gathering lifestyle.
Let's look a little bit at the comparison, you know, the plus and minuses.
Hunting and gathering lifestyle is awesome, and there are many different viewpoints, except for one major weakness.
You need to constantly find fresh food.
Since you don't really have a way to store food, because since you're nomadic and you're moving around,
the only food you can store is the one you carry on your back,
realistically, you probably have food for you to last you two, three, four days.
After that, you need to find fresh food.
In a stable environment, that's not a problem.
But in an unstable one, you do run the risk of dying of starvation.
If you do live in one of those environments, then you may start feeling the pressure of leaving next to the crops that you rely on,
to guard them from animals and people trying to take them,
and also you can get a lot more calories per acre, leaving as a farmer than leaving as a hunter and gatherers.
So in some places, people will begin to do that, and indeed, that's been in the Americas the same way as it's happened in other parts of the world.
One of the first things that happened when people settled down in sedentary villages is that the population usually grows,
because whereas it's really inconvenient to carry kids that don't walk around,
I mean, yeah, kids begin to walk about one or something, but
you never gone for a walk with a two-year-old, tiny little legs, they have to take 50,000 steps to go 30 feet.
You know, you really end up carrying them most of the time, it's not until they are four or five that they can actually walk efficiently.
So most hunters and gatherers intentionally made sure not to have kids back to back,
because you could only really afford one kid that you have to carry if you need your other hand to carry all your possessions.
Among farmers, once you start living in a sedentary village, you can pop out a kid every year if you want,
you don't really need to space them apart, so populations start growing with farming,
and these will have also an effect on power and wealth distribution.
You know, what happens is that as you start having more and more people living in a small environment,
people start getting on each other nerves, you ask your leaders to mediate,
and maybe the way it begins is that you say, look, we understand that this is a pain for you and it's unfair,
because we're asking you to do so much more work,
but you know, you're helping us make sure we don't kill each other and make sure everybody gets along,
so about this, you don't need to plant, we'll plant for you, you just do this full time, you help us keep society together.
There for the first time in human history you have the experience of somebody who is extra special,
somebody who has this extra power whose role is different from everyone else.
It's a very small step, but it's the first of many steps that will lead to social stratification,
to hierarchy, to kings and queens and slaves.
You know, when it begins, it's very minor.
Somebody having just a slightly nicer house than everyone else, somebody having...
but as time goes on, as the society grows, then this difference becomes magnified.
And also, whereas among hunters and gatherers, nobody could grow wealthy, because there's really no point accumulating stuff,
if you have to carry it on your back.
Once you become sedentary and you live in one place, only you're long, that's a different story then,
because then you have... you can accumulate wealth.
So, becoming sedentary is the first step to inequality, to finding major differences in wealth and power distribution.
Incidentally, becoming a farmer is not always a good deal, not only because of the loss of freedom
that sometimes goes in a very hierarchical society, but in terms of diet and health,
hunters and gatherers, when they are not starving, they are way healthier than farmers,
because they have a very healthy diet that relies on many different things that our body needs.
Most farmers rely on just a very few crops, so they have enough calories to go on, they are not starving,
but their nutrition is poor because they don't have access to the full range of vitamins and nutrients
that our body needs to function optimally.
So, that's another one of the downsides of becoming a farmer.
Okay, having said all that, I want to wrap things up with a quick overview of life in North America before contact with Europeans,
so we'll take kind of a sense of different parts of North America before 1492, how people lived.
On the west coast, people remain hunters and gatherers. They knew about farming, but they are no interest in it,
because they have plenty of resources, so hunting and gathering all along.
Once you move a little further inland, in places like Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico,
what the environment like there, usually a lot drier, a bit harsher, so people there did become farmers.
There's a sequence of different farming civilization that supersede one another.
One of the most recent are one that sometimes referred to as the Anazazi.
Anazazi is not the name of a tribe that they give to themselves,
Anazazi is when Europeans came around and they found the ruins that the Anazazi left behind.
They asked some local tribe who did that, and some tribe there used the word Anazazi, which meant ancient enemies, or enemies of our ancestors.
Likely the Anazazi were the ancestors of modern tribes like the Hopi, Zuni and other Pueblo tribes.
They thrived somewhere between the 600s and the 1300s, and they built a very large-scale society,
plenty of evidence of long-distance trade among them, with Mexico and with deep into the United States.
They built the tallest buildings in North America, it wasn't until the 1880s when they started building skyscrapers in Chicago,
where anything was built taller than that.
In many ways they had a great life.
On the PowerPoint you can see some pictures of the ruins in New Mexico, Arizona and places like that.
They had it pretty good for a while.
The problem is they started becoming too successful for their own good.
Their population kept growing, which meant they started taking more and more resources from the environment.
Until eventually, shortly before the 1300s, a period of major drought hit the south, actually all of North America,
which led to a sudden dramatic collapse in the resources.
When your population is already growing a lot and suddenly resources collapse, now we have a problem.
So even though the Anazazi had been very peaceful for a long time, when people begin to starve, they usually don't stay peaceful very long.
So we find evidence of things really going bad for the Anazazi, a lot more signs of warfare, a lot more signs of pretty ugly things
happening to the point that eventually by the 1300s, all the major Anazazi sites are abandoned.
There's clearly a population collapse, and the survivor of this rather nasty period will eventually practice a similar lifestyle
but on a much smaller scale. So clearly, things didn't go so well around that time in the southwest.
Let's look at other areas of North America.
Similar pattern, not as extreme throughout the Great Plains.
There you find people start settling in sedentary villages, mainly leaving along the edges of some of the major rivers across the plains,
using the water for irrigation.
And much like what I mentioned regarding the Anazazi, you do find increased signs of warfare in the 1300s,
indicating that this period of drought and low resources was also present in the middle of the continent.
Throughout the North East, both hunting and gathering as well as farming.
When I say farming, by the way, the three main crops that you find used in North America over and over again,
typically are corn, squash and beans. Those are the big ones.
So that's what you find, you know, large tribal society living in sedentary villages, as well as somewhat smaller ones, living as hunters and gatherers.
But the one place that's the most bizarre in pre-Columbia, North America, is somewhat in the southeast and in the mid-east.
I don't know why actually we don't use that word, we use the term mid-west, but there's no mid-east in any case.
All along the Mississippi River.
There there's a culture that historians will refer to as the Mississippians, who start thriving right around the same time as the Anazazi,
roughly between the 700s and the 1300s common era.
And these guys grow really large. They build, forget villages, these guys build cities.
One of their big ones, Cahokia, which is next to Mother Dyson, Louisa, had at least 10,000 people living in there,
possibly 30,000, which may not sound like much today, but for those time it was a huge city.
They build pyramids, they build very large scale, they have a major hierarchy with the nobles, the kings and queens and slaves.
In many ways they resemble a lot of society in Mesoamerica.
Societies like the Maya or the Aztec or those guys, and even in several ways they build pyramids.
That's kind of a big one. They practice human sacrifice, which is something that tribes in North America usually didn't do.
Their iconography was similar to Mesoamerica.
Many people think that there may have been long distance trade between indigenous people from Mexico,
coming to the Mississippi River by boat, cutting across the Gulf of Mexico, spreading their ideas,
and these ideas became a big hit among the local population along the Mississippi.
But much like what had happened with the Anazasi, the Mississippians become too big for their own good
and will collapse during that period of drought and environmental crisis that hit North America in the 1300s.
What they leave behind are these huge mounds, signs of these complex civilizations, but all of these will be abandoned by the time Europeans come along.
Europeans and that would be really puzzled about who built this stuff.
Ancestors of tribes are probably still living there by the time Europeans show up, but the memory of that culture is in some way long gone at that time.
So having said all that, we are sort of setting the stage for 1492 and the encounter between Europeans and natives.
One final remark, there's a whole debate regarding how many people lived in the Americas before 1492.
And I won't get technical or bore you with all the details, but there are, of course, this is not an exact science.
The reality is nobody knows exactly how many people lived there.
We know that it was in the millions.
If you, what's today, US and Canada was probably in the neighborhood of 10, somewhere between 8 and 18 million are some of the most typical approximate guesses.
For the entirety of the continent, including North America, plus Central and South, more like in the 75 million plus.
So clearly, this was not an empty continent.
There were millions of native people living here by the time Europeans will show up.
We do know that Europeans show up before Columbus.
Around the year 1000, the Vikings come to the east coast of North America, but they are not going to stick around long.
They turn around, go back to Europe.
So while they are here before Columbus, they really don't leave much of an impact on world history.
Unlike what's going to happen when Columbus shows up.
And with that, we have just covered a few thousands years of history.
Now, I know it's really close, and in an hour or whatever long this took, we have sketched out thousands upon thousands of years.
But that's the reality of studying history.
Very often, the closer we get to us, the more actual sources and informations we have.
So we can go into a lot more depth.
When it comes to going far back into the past, we have to rely on very limited sources.
So I personally find the topic fascinating.
Incredibly interesting, while life was like in North America, 13,000 years ago, 12,000 years ago, 11,000 years ago, I think.
The whole idea of human life before civilization, as we know it, is incredibly interesting.
But the problem is we just don't, we lack sources, we lack information.
So we did the sketched out as best as we could, the more generalized portrait of this.
Of course, if you are interested in this topic, there are lots of books, lots of sources specializing in some.
Like for example, the Mississippians, there are all sorts of archaeological books getting into, they wear what they did, all of it.
Many of these sources are 99 parts speculation and one part hard facts.
Because again, we don't have a whole lot of hard facts.
So I try to give you at least a more general overview of the topic.
Now that we wrap that up, with the next one, we are going to jump into the encounter between the native peoples of this continent and Europeans when Columbus will show up.
Having said that, you're probably tired of hearing my Italian accent by now and to give you a break from it all.
Until next time, have a good one.
