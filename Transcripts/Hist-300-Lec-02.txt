Welcome guys to lecture number two. By the way, when I say guys, it's my nono, it's my generic term for everybody. It's like saying folks, men, women, goats, anybody listening, your goldfish, whatever.
Point being, before we get going with an narration of the interaction between the native people of this continent and Columbus, there are a couple of more philosophical themes I want to explore a little bit.
One thing they are going to notice when looking at the way Europeans would relate to native peoples is that often they describe native peoples in very stereotypical ways.
And historians have usually grouped the stereotypes of their two headings. What they put quote unquote, they refer to as noble savage versus quote unquote to the refer as vicious savage.
And it's nothing to do with native people themselves. This is all about the mindset of Europeans coming over and out this mindset influence the perception.
And because they are unlike us and we are good and wonderful people, they must be vicious and horrible.
So the vicious savage stereotypes are basically classic racism, you know, the sort of you're going to season every lurid room or you've heard about a population.
You argue that every single one of them behaved as way. And the end result is that you portray a very ugly image of native life.
They are all cannibals. They all torture their enemies. They all do, you know, this whole series of things that basically is the exact opposite of what you value.
Hence the image of native people as the vicious savages.
That one is probably the more common stereotype that we're used to hearing, but there's also another kind.
What's referred to as noble savages was still a stereotype, but of a different kind.
This is Europeans who had some issues with their own culture, who considered European civilization a bit corrupt and in a state of decay.
They would look with hope that anybody was different from them.
So in this case, when they would run into different people, such as native people of the Americas, they would say they are different from us.
So they are savages, but they are that's actually a good thing. They are noble savages. They are uncorrupted by civilization.
They are naturally honest and merciful. They have a good heart.
And you portray this very idealized image, somewhat of a romanticized image of native life.
The reality of course is that native people didn't fit either stereotypes. They were not the kendun orong, always sweet and wonderful image that emerged from the noble savages stereotype.
And they were not the blood-torsity cannibals of the vicious savages stereotypes.
They were human beings, like anybody else, with the amazing good qualities, with the terrible ones and everything in between.
So what exactly are these noble savages versus vicious savages stereotypes? Basically what that's about is it tells you something about the mindset of Europeans coming to the Americans, some projecting all their fears of native Americans,
viewing difference as something evil and wrong.
And so their description will be painted by these to create this sense of ugliness and general negative image of native peoples.
And other people will portray them always in idealized terms, rather than projecting their fear on native people, they project their hopes and dreams on them.
And so they write in a way as to wish to see those hopes and dreams realized, and so they portray natives in these very romanticized terms.
Just wanted to make you aware of it, because the reality is, you know, most people can't deal with the complexity of history and life for the matter.
And the fact that most people are not absolute good or absolute evil, and they are not even just a shade of grey, because sometimes some people are much more leaning one way than another.
You know, there's a quote by author Jared Diamon, the perfect capture of this, Diamon wrote,
History, as well as life itself, is complicated. Neither life nor history is an enterprise for those who seek simplicity and consistency.
Which, kind of the truth right there, you know, the...
Artualistic minds tend to like to cling to these old good or all evil images.
Native history, and for the matter, any human history doesn't really fit in this.
It would be doing violence to try to make it fit, because it's not that simple.
And since we're talking about mental construct, another one that's worth exploring before we look at the encounter between Columbus and native peoples,
is the whole issue of ethnic identity, the whole issue of nationalism, patriotism, ethnic identity.
However, you want to define it, but basically being an identity based on a group that you are born into that is not necessarily by choice,
is something that you are part of.
And human beings across the globe seem to really enjoy to run with this sense of identity.
It seems to...
You know, one of the standard things that you hear, even down to this day, is that different nations stand for something.
It's not that you just happen to carry the same passport and somebody else, and that's really what you have in common.
And maybe you have in common language or a few other things, but no, you share the same values.
And that's something that I would invite you to think about, just for yourself, not for an assignment or anything else, just as a thought, that how much do you really share with people from your same nation that you cannot share for people across the globe?
And I'm not saying you can share anything.
There probably are some things you share there, right?
If you are born in the same nation, you probably speak the same language.
You may have grown up watching the same cartoons.
There may be some cultural characteristics that are somewhat shared.
But of course, individuals are more complex.
They are not simple robots replicating the culture that's downloaded into their brain.
You know, how much of the culture you absorb, how much you reject, how much you mix with something else,
individuals are greater than any one culture.
They can mix things more than stereotypes would lead you to believe.
And so when we say that a whole population shares certain values, I'm not completely sold with that idea.
I mean, I understand if you tell me that you live in a small tribe or a family or a small community,
and you say, we share certain values, I believe it, because you probably sit down at a table,
talk with each other.
So if you tell me you share certain values, I get it.
I also understand the idea of shared values at a human level, certain things that are desirable for human life to be healthy.
I get that too.
The middle level that is too big, like a nation, for example, or an ethnic group, which is too big for being a face-to-face community.
You know, you don't know everybody in the same nation as where you grew up.
You don't know everybody was your same skin color.
So it's not a face-to-face community, and yet it's not inclusive of all human beings.
That's a level where I kind of have a hard time seeing shared values across an entire group.
You know, for example, you hear about U.S. being, you know, one of the classic values attached to American identities,
the idea of freedom.
But, you know, do Canadians believe in tyranny and oppression?
How is this just only an American thing?
You know, there are millions of people across the globe who like freedom.
There are governments across the globe who endorse freedom.
So, you know, anytime we tie one value and imply that every single one from the sweet,
old lady who bake you cookies to the serial rapist in prison,
everybody from a certain country, they all have the same values,
and those values are not shared with people from another place,
it's always a little of a sketchy concept.
Now, why am I telling you this?
For a couple of reasons, because when you have different groups encountering one another,
their perception of who we are and who they are is going to shape the interaction.
Whether that perception is accurate or not is a whole other thing,
but the fact that that perception has an impact on how they treat one another is a very real thing.
And it's funny, too, by the way, that identity is somewhat malleable, you know, it's flexible.
I'll give you an example. I originally come from Italy.
And so, you know, there may be, among some people, the sense of Italian patriotism.
We have this identity as good Italian people.
But the second, there is an external enemy, they are comparing yourself with.
When people look inside Italy as a country, they're all like,
yes, Italy is great and wonderful, we are all proud Italians.
Well, except for you guys from the south, I don't know about you guys,
I guess you're Italian, but not really.
What I really meant by Italy is the north, that's the real Italy, the other guys are, eh, so-so.
Well, if you wanna get technical, even in the north,
Bergamo is only 50 miles away, but those guys speak kind of weird, they eat funny food.
I guess they are Italian, but what I'm really trying to say, Italy is more the city, Milan, that's Italy, that's the real deal.
Not the outskirts of town, though, because that's why trash, more about the central part of town.
So now that identity has shrunk to the level of your neighborhoods,
except that your neighbors pump up the music at 2am and you hate them.
So it's your family, minus your brother, who's an ass.
You know, that sense of identity can, at an individual level, yes, you do have certain values.
There's probably a lot that you share with family and friends.
But once you move from that level to the city, the region, the state, the nation,
my way of looking at things, what is shared there, becomes really thin.
I mean, there is something, don't get me wrong, but not enough to base on who you like and who you don't,
who you're gonna be friends and who you're not going to be, who you're gonna to war with or against.
That's really not enough to me to bind people together.
Now, I'm completely in the minority, because in most of the world, that's how it works.
People will assume that that identity means something that I don't really think it does.
But the point being is, sometime even if you, let's say, argue that you are a unique individual
and yes, you do share some cultural characteristic with people from your nation or ethnic group
or whatever that may be, by your own person, well, that's fine and all, but outsiders may not see you that way at all.
They may see you purely representative of culture, eh?
And based on what kind of stereotypes they have about that culture, they may embrace you as a friend or want to shoot you dead.
That has nothing to do with who you are as a person, has everything to do with where you fit into their own mental stereotypes,
whether you look like the part of, you know, guys who have that skin color
or guys who come from such and such country, this is what we believe about them,
which is why I went through the whole noble savage vicious savage and all of that, because the kind of stereotypes,
no matter how inaccurate they are, the people holding their heads, will shape with interaction with other people,
sometime in pretty dramatic kind of ways.
So just wanted to throw it out there, because we're about to look at one of the greatest encounters in human history
between populations who didn't know about one another,
and so these ideas are going to come into play immediately.
The second Columbus and Tainonatives meet each other on the beach, that's going to come into play.
So just want to make you aware of it, make you think a little bit about it,
about what that means and the dynamics that entails and see, you know, just question it for yourself.
How much do you think it's a real deal, how much we overplay it and so on and so forth.
It's kind of funny, by the way, I would generally today, unless you guys hang out with the KKK or something,
racism as a bad name, and you know, for good reasons, because, you know, what's wrong with racism?
racism, the problem is that you're assuming that certain values that you see as very negative
are shared by every single person who has a particular skin color or come from a certain nation.
And why do we say that's stupid, because we know that, that's not our reality works.
Bunch of people with the same skin color, they're not all the same.
There are some sweet people, there are horrible people, there are some sweet people in every nation, there are horrible people.
Some will share your values, some will not.
So racism is basically intellectual laziness, because you are trying to force a stereotype on everybody,
rather than having to do the work to get to know people individually, you can plug them into this mental category you have in your head,
and then you're done, you can act as if you know them.
And we recognize today that that's just stupid.
The problem with patriotism, ethnic pride, nationalism, is that we kind of do the same thing there.
Now, whereas racism is, we have these negative stereotypes about those people and we judge them badly,
the way ethnic pride, nationalism and patriotism work is we have these positive stereotypes about our people,
and we imagine that everyone shares into them.
It's less ugly than racism, because it's about propping up a group as opposed to putting down another group,
but the mentality behind it, the notion that everybody from a certain country with a certain skin color share the same values,
is the same.
It's the other side of the coin, it's just that one is the positive and one is the negative, but they're the same thing.
In any case, feel free to completely disagree, that's just the way I look at it.
Let's look at the hard facts now, let's look at 1492 and everything that led to it.
So the country that's going to finance Columbus trips to the America will be Spain.
Spain had an interesting history, they were invaded by Muslim armies coming from North Africa,
and they spent about 700 years or so trying to get their independence back.
And after much religiously motivated warfare, they were able to get their independence back at the beginning of the 1300s.
So Spanish culture was very much characterized by this notion of fighting in the name of God of kind of religious warfare as a huge part of their identity.
At this time, the main reason why they will decide to finance Columbus trip is not to discover new lands or anything like that.
One thing that many people wanted in Europe was access to East Asian markets, specifically for spices and other luxury goods that were produced in East Asia that Europeans wanted.
If you think about it, it's kind of weird to go off into the ocean looking for Asia because you know where Asia is.
I mean, we call Europe and Asia two continents, but they're really one big landmass.
You can walk your way from Spain to China if you want.
And people had done it before, which is why they knew that there was all this demand for Asian luxury goods.
The reason why they were looking for another route, and that's where Columbus comes in, is because A took a long way to go from Europe to East Asia.
And they were trying to save time.
But also more importantly, politically speaking, there was an obstacle in the way.
Around the 13 and 1400s, you know, what's between East Asia and Europe, politically speaking, and religiously speaking, well, a whole bunch of Muslim countries.
Christian and Muslims did not love each other a whole lot around this period of time.
So it's not exactly surprising that Christian traders wanted to find a way to get to Asia that did not require them to travel through Muslim countries where
things could get tense.
So that's part of the reason why they were sending out ships into the ocean to find a way to Asia.
So, in the meantime, let's look at what was going on in the Americas.
Where Columbus will eventually land is not the mainland of the continent.
It doesn't arrive in what's today US or Canada or Mexico or any of those places.
He lands in some islands in the Caribbean.
In the islands out here, there was an extremely large native population there.
They had come there a few centuries earlier, migrating from South America.
Many of the native cultures that evolved in the R and the islands, they were, they lived by fishing, hunting, gathering.
But they also cultivated, they planted corn, squash, beans, sweet potatoes and things like that.
So that's what we're looking at here.
Now, if you go back to your elementary school, junior high and so on, you may have had a different experience, but more likely than not, the way the story has been told is in very glowing terms.
Columbus and these three ships, they go off into the ocean.
By the way, if you are confused by my pronunciation, I pronounce the word sheep as in the animal and the word sheep as like a large boat, the exact same way.
Sorry about that, I've tried 10,000 times.
So no, he's not riding three woolly ships to get to the Americas, he's going in big boats.
Columbus will arrive and the way the 1492 stories often depicted is in these very glowing terms of Columbus arrived, they shake hands with the natives on the beach and then kind of the natives disappear off into the sunset and we don't really hear much about them anymore.
The big deal is Columbus arrived and discovered the Americas.
I mean, you even hear it, there's still a Columbus Day holiday that's celebrated, well, kind of, you know, we don't really get a day off of school or anything, it's just your bank is closed or something, but...
President Bush, senior, you know, there were two of them, the older one, the father, had this quote about Columbus where he said,
Christopher Columbus not only opened the door to a new word, but also set an example for us all by showing what monumental feats can be accomplished through perseverance and fate.
So the overall tone of the quote is clearly very positive, right?
When you dig a little deeper into what happens between Columbus and the natives, the story gets a lot uglier.
And it's not a put down on Columbus, per se, he's a single human being, it's more...
Columbus very much represented European culture of the time.
You know, he was supposedly from Italy navigating under Spanish flag, regardless, it doesn't matter, it's Western Europe as a whole, there are certain cultural characteristics that come into play here.
You get a clue right away from looking at Columbus diaries.
Columbus described the initial encounter with the native people, specifically the tribe that he ran into or referred to as the Taíno.
And the Taíno natives come across really well in Columbus description, he say how amazed these guys were to see these large ships coming with these white-skinned people,
jumping off the boats, they were really curious about everything, but they were very generous, very hospitable.
They even thought they didn't share a language, they couldn't really communicate well, they would give away some of their food, they would invite them in, they were trying to figure them out essentially, but nothing negative about it.
But if you read Columbus diaries, he finished going off saying how sweet they are and how nice they are and this and that, and he goes on to say something like, and so it's going to be really easy to enslave them.
And you're like, whoa, let me read that again.
You just finished saying they are nice, they are sweet, they are this and that, so easy to enslave.
How does that work? I'm not sure about you guys, but you know, when I meet a new person, I'm like, hey, I met so and so today, a really cool new person.
I don't think great, I got a new slave.
So what's the mindset there? What is that's leading to?
And basically what boils down to a lot is what we discussed last time in the first lecture, the difference between inclusive and exclusive religious worldviews.
The Taino are very reflective or an inclusive one. They don't know anything about Columbus, but in their view, diversity is not necessarily evil.
Maybe Columbus and the Spaniards are cool, maybe they are not. Well, let's figure it out.
Come on in, have some dinner and in the meantime we'll figure out how we can get along.
That's the more inclusive approach where you have to decide case by case.
The exclusive one, which was very prevalent in the Christianity of the times, was really simple.
When Columbus arrived and he realized that these people are not Christian, it's all he needs to know.
Doesn't matter that, yeah, you're nice guys, that's sweet, you are still servants of the devil, whether you know it or not.
You're still not one of us, you're not on the same plane.
So his idea of, well, we can always enslave them is because by virtue of not sharing in the same worldview, that means that you are really kind of a so-be human, that you could be a target of slavery, you could be a target for all the other stuff.
And that's kind of what happens here, that we see, you know, while the initial encounter with between Columbus and the Tainos Pleasant, they get along for a little while, that's quickly going to give way to some really ugly story, where thanks to technological superiority,
the Spaniards are able to start enslaving, raping, killing, enormously last large number of natives there.
Part of the reason for the enslavement is that Columbus and the Spaniards had showed up to find these expensive trading luxury goods, to bring back to Spain.
Well, they didn't find it, despite the fact that they believe these may have been India, they do not find what they want, so they get a little nervous because back in Spain, they haven't paid for their trip to be adventurers.
They paid for their trip so that they could get it, gather a thorn, it need to financially make sense, and they are not bringing back the luxury goods everybody want.
So what else can they do? Well, Columbus and this guy's noticed that many of the natives there have trinklets made of silver, and they're like, okay, well, that's a good second option, we can open silver mines, we can enslave the Tainos, put them to work in it, here we go.
And that's exactly what's going to happen, that very quickly the friendly interaction gives way to one based on domination and slavery.
There was this system that if you didn't dig enough, you don't bring it back enough gold or silver, you would have your hand chopped off.
The Spaniards used terror tactics to scare the population into submission.
And when you hear the stories of what happens in the Caribbean following Columbus arrival, it's really just a analogy of murder, brutality, rape and all of the other stuff, really, really ugly story.
And, you know, the Spaniards just could pull it off. There was technologically they were on a military standpoint superior to the natives.
This is not always going to be the case, by the way, we're going to see other places where that's not the case, but they were in the Caribbean, so they are able to pull that off.
Beside technological superiority, they did have something that's going to be even more important that technology or anything else is going to be the one thing that's going to help European conquest of the continent.
And specifically boils down to diseases.
The Americas at this time were relatively disease free.
They did not have many of the epidemic diseases that affected Europe, Africa and Asia.
No smallpox, no scarlet fever, no whooping cough, no plague, no none of those things.
And the reason why it's simple is that the place where we get most of our epidemic diseases is because of close contact with farm animals.
You know, the India Americas, they domesticated plants, but they did not domesticated animals other than dogs sometime or very few other species.
In America, in Europe, Asia and Africa, they domesticated pigs and cows and chickens and goats and sheep and you name it.
There are a bunch of viruses that these species have.
Because of living in close contact with human beings, they mutate in such a way that they can then attach themselves to a human host and they become human diseases.
That's where from, you know, even here today, things like the bird flu or the pig swine flu or things like that, that's where they come from.
And you know, they come because some of these viruses are airborne, just by breathing the same air, you can get it.
Some of them are because of blood to blood contact.
One, also that I'm going to share just for the sake of grossing you guys out.
One of the most disgusting statistics I've ever read was, I forgot which country was, but the same old's true for pretty much everywhere where people lived on farms with farm animals.
An enormously high percentage of males had reported that their first sexual experience had been with a barn animal.
You know, you spend lots of time alone on the farm.
The sheep start looking more and more attractive by the minute.
Yeah, I know, gross, but in any case, point being there's more than one way to transmit diseases from animals to human beings and everywhere when human beings have domesticated animals, they have experienced some of these ways.
So long story short, Europe, Asia and Africa were exposed to a lot of these diseases, they were completely unknown in the Americas.
By the way, for the rest of the day, you guys are going to try to shake off that image of the very disturbing image of the sheep.
And you will fail, I must say, because it's going to be there for a while, but in any case.
Point being, it sounds like being in the Americas would be a lot cooler, because it's like, do you want to be in a place where lots of diseases or with few diseases?
Well, clearly it's a lot better.
The problem is that by the time you meet people from these cultures that have these diseases, well, you have no antibodies against these diseases.
No, you, not anybody in your family, none of your ancestors have a good disease.
So you are much more vulnerable.
A Spaniard may show up in your villages, knees over somebody, and next week half of the village is dead.
You know, Spaniards, not just Spaniards, but Europeans in general, African-sations, they have worked in immunity.
You know, the people who survived to a dull stage, many of them had a much higher degree of resistance against some of these diseases than people who would encounter them for the first time.
So this is a tremendous advantage that Europeans will have when they show up.
And it'd been the other way around that natives have domesticated animals and no Europeans.
Europeans should have showed up, started dying like flies, and turned around and say, never go to the continent because that's death.
And it'd been the both Europeans and natives had domesticated animals.
Well, Europeans would not have had an advantage of numbers when they show up, you know, they are not...
Because the problem with natives is that as they are gonna be fighting wars with Europeans, they're also gonna have to be dealing with these waves of diseases that kill thousands of them.
So of course, that weaken you, even if you are technologically superior, even if you were at larger numbers, if you get wiped out by some major diseases at the same time, that's gonna make it a lot harder for you to win a war.
So, at the knob in the case, then Europeans may have conquered some places, but in other places they would have had a very hard time.
But the fact that across the board, everywhere in the Americas, wherever they went, these major epidemic diseases would strike the population and wipe out large percentage of them, made it so much easier for Europeans to conquer.
Much more than weapons made of steel, much more than any technological advantage, mainly was the diseases.
In some places native people died with mortality rate between 50 to 90% after being exposed to some of these diseases.
Imagine that for a second. Nine out of ten people, you know, dying of some nasty disease while you're trying to fight to hold on to your land.
It's impossible. There's no way you can win under those conditions.
At this time in the 1459, there's nobody understood germs and viruses and the way diseases were passed along.
For example, when the English Puritans would arrive and they would see that native people die like flies all around them, their interpretation will be,
thank you God, for clearing the land of the zumbeliver so that we can prosper.
Incidentally, this will also have an impact on slavery because when Europeans try to enslave natives, but natives die like flies, then they have to go out and capture more and more and more.
Then they start running out of people.
So then sometimes they enslave their own people. They had a bunch of indentured servants coming from Europe.
But even that was problematic. So they figured, okay, who are some people who are, they look different enough from us that we feel comfortable in slaving?
And they are different enough that if they run away, they are easier to catch.
But they share the same disease as with us.
That's where the Africans live trade come from. It's because natives were dying at a high rate.
So the favorite source became Africa, where you bring in Africans, they stand out because they have a difference in color from white people.
They resist European diseases more than natives and they don't know the land as well as natives.
So if they escape, it's a little harder for them to set up independent communities.
So this factor about the biological element of the conquest is a huge one.
It has a very, very big impact on the whole thing.
So in any case, we have established today a few important things.
This element about the role that diseases will play in the meeting between natives and Europeans is extremely important.
It's probably the single most important factor to understand why things played out the way they did in terms of Europeans being able to conquer the Americas.
And by the way, despite this enormous advantage, it's still going to take hundreds of years for the conquest to be over.
So it's still not easy to even this tremendous biological advantage.
So that gives you an idea of how you really wouldn't have happened otherwise.
The encounter between the two continents produces the single greatest demographic catastrophe that we know of in modern human history.
The near dramatic destruction of the population of the Americas, largely because of diseases but also because of warfare, is one of those very heavy events in human history.
In any case, I will wrap things up for today.
I will continue on. We're probably going to do a really short lecture next time, more about the Spanish conquest in other parts, because right now we just saw Columbus and these guys going into the Caribbean, and that's it.
We'll see how the Spaniards will extend their domination across all the islands, and eventually they're going to start moving toward mainland.
And we're going to discuss that at least briefly next time.
But for today, with Rob Singh's ear, have a very good one.
