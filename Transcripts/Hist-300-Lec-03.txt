Welcome to lecture number three in this series.
Last time we finished off talking about the meeting between Columbus and the Taino in the carbeans.
Today we are looking at something else. Well actually closely related because we are still going to stick to Spanish conquest throughout the other islands and then on some of the main lands of the American continent.
The reason why we keep talking about Spaniards and natives for a while is because as far as Europeans go they will be the Spaniards are the main dominant power on the ocean.
Throughout much of the 1500s there is nobody who can challenge them. So they really are a little bit the Portuguese, sure, but primarily it will be the Spaniards who will come to the Americas and try to colonize left and right.
It's not going to be until late in the 1500s that other European groups are going to be able to start doing the same thing.
So what happens with the Spaniards is that for the next, after Columbus for the next 20 to 30 years they are going to kind of be highland open, just jumping from one island to the other throughout the area, conquering progressively more and more territories, more conquering, you know, defeating more people and all that kind of stuff.
These will be from the point of view of the native people of the area. This is an absolute catastrophe.
The number, it's estimated that the Caribbean were inhabited by a lot of people. Some estimates suggest, for example, just for the Ta√≠no population they suggest that there may have been half a million of them and within 20 to 30 years there will be only 3,000 of them left.
In other places there are estimates by Bartolomeo de las Casas, for example, was a Spanish priest who suggested that there are possibly somewhere in the neighborhoods of 3 million people living in the Caribbean and again only thousands would be left just a few decades later.
Through a combination of death by diseases, being over war, credent, enslaved, native women not wanting to give birth to kids who are going to be born into slavery or sometime killing their own kids if when they were born, that gives you a sense of the desperation that people are experiencing.
Death through warfare, bottom line, a complete demographic catastrophe for the native people of the area.
For the old world instead, these were a fairly good deal. They got, and I don't mean just pain, I mean, because what happened is that while the main thing that came to the Americas, the new thing that didn't exist out here that much, where a lot of the epidemic diseases,
the encounter between the old world and the new world will have a rather different demographic impact on the old world.
Specifically, there are a lot of crops and plants coming from the Americas.
They will contribute to growing numbers throughout Asia, Africa and Europe.
Casing point, crops like potatoes.
Potatoes, that's an American crop.
Fairly easy to grow, very calorie heavy.
So what happens is that when potatoes are brought back to Europe and then traded to Asia and to Africa, they will contribute dramatically to a higher number of people being able to keep starvation away
and surviving long enough to have kids and their kids will have kids and so on.
So even just the impacts of potato alone will lead to a demographic increase in the old world.
Add a bunch of other things that came from the Americas.
Things like tomatoes, that's an American crop, corn, that's an American crop, chocolate, also from the Americas.
There's interesting enough things like tobacco, that's an American crop as well.
So the old world got a whole lot of desirable stuff, whereas the Americas got mainly a bunch of diseases.
During this period in which the Spaniards following Columbus original expedition started visiting one after another of the native communities in the Caribbean.
One curious habit that they engaged in was reading this document known as the Requerimiento.
The Requerimiento was some curious document that was crafted by theologians back in Spain.
And it would basically read something like this.
I believe there's the full text in the book American Holocaust by Devin Stanner, that I'm sure you can find it online or other places as well.
But the message of the Requerimiento, these were something that Spanish soldiers were required to read when they arrive into a new land.
And the text said something that if the natives were to accept to become subject of the king of Spain, then they could keep their land and kind of become vassals of the king of Spain.
But if they refuse, well then they just brought it upon themselves to be attacked, to, you know, they became legitimate targets of warfare, and they could be killed and enslaved.
Which in itself is kind of a weird choice.
You know, do you want to be my subject or do you want me to kill the Andine's Laveo?
Sort of like, well, I'd rather have a third option here because neither one of the first two sound great.
But the thing that made it even weirder is the fact that the choice wasn't really a choice.
You know, the Requerimiento is usually read either in Latin or in Spanish.
Clearly neither language was understood or spoken by native peoples.
So the typical scene would be some Spanish soldiers reading the document to a group of confused natives who have no idea what's been said.
And then it would be okay, going once, going twice, doesn't look like they are surrendered, okay, so we can start killing.
You know, there's more something that made the people back home feel they could pat themselves on the back and feel good about the whole process, because they were giving native such a choice, when in reality there really wasn't much of a choice in this.
But in any case, after conquering everything there was to conquer among in the islands in the Caribbean.
The Spaniards began to set their sights on the mainland.
They began understanding that there was something else, a lot bigger, probably not even an island, maybe it was an actual continent, Forter West.
They began invading places like modern day Panama to set up a base over there.
And then the real big story in this will be when the Spaniards starting in 1519, you know, groups of Spaniards starting from Cuba will decide to go west to the area that would be modern day Mexico.
And that's when the Spaniards under Cortez will run into this extremely large empire, known, popularly today the people who are living in the country,
the people from that empire known as the Aztecs.
It's not exactly how they called themselves the correct term would be the Mexica, from which then the term Mexico come from.
However you want to call them, these were not, you know, the small scale society found in the Caribbean.
These were not a group of hunters and gatherers.
This was an extremely large and complex civilization with hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people just living within this empire.
And even the world itself, this was an empire, you know, the Mexica built, they didn't live in villages, they lived in super complex large cities with tens of thousands,
or in the case of Tenochitlan, the capital of the Mexica empire, hundreds of thousands of people.
This was one of the most advanced civilizations in the world at this time, and the Spaniards were about to bump into them.
Now, let me tell you something about this story.
If you are interested in this tale, you know, what I'm gonna do now in this lecture is give you the five minute version, you know, make it super quick and to the point.
But if you are interested in this tale, and you wouldn't mind exploring it further, I've done a series about the encounter between the Spaniards and the Mexica for my history on fire podcast.
I've recorded a total of about four episodes on this topic, each one is in the hour and the half to hour range, so you're looking at seven to eight hours on this topic.
They are respectively episode 20, 21, 22, 23 of the history on fire podcast.
So if you are interested and you want to dig deeper, well, there's plenty where that came from, so you can check that out.
If you're not on the other end, you just want to get the basics, I'm just gonna provide it in the next few minutes here.
But just to let you know that the resources available, if you want to dig a little deeper.
So let me just give you the basic of this story.
Essentially, what happened is Cortes was...
Cortes, his operation was part military expedition part piracy, because Cortes technically been given command to go explore this land to the west.
But the governor of Cuba tried to take back their command. Cortes had left with some 1500 men in violation of the governor's orders.
So his whole expedition was a gamble.
If he discovered this big civilization that he heard so much about and he was indeed as wealthy as advertised,
he could come back to Spain a rich man and the king would forgive him for having broken with orders.
And if he failed, he probably died anyway, so didn't really matter that he broke with the governor of Cuba.
He just didn't want to, for the governor of Cuba, to appoint someone else and for someone else to be reaping the glory.
So Cortes and these guys, they leave Cuba in 1519.
As I mentioned a minute ago, the civilization the Spaniards will run into.
The civilization that dominated the most of central Mexico and parts of southern Mexico.
Where the Mexica?
The Mexica are an incredibly complex, highly stratified civilization.
You had an nobility with kings and queens and slaves and everything in between.
In many ways it mirrored the same kind of society that you found in all the large civilization across the world.
Whether you're talking ancient China, ancient Egypt, you name it.
It's the same kind of pattern emerges.
They practice large scale agriculture so they could get enough food to feed an extremely large population.
They built pyramids.
There are a few slides in the power points where you can check out what a Mexica city would have looked like.
They were extremely militaristic.
They were big on the conquest of other people.
That's how they built their empire by being a really tough warrior and conquering one nation after another.
And this process of conquest led to a system where they extracted tributes from the people they had defeated.
Tributes both in goods but also in blood.
And this is what I mean.
Mesoamerican religion, the kind of religion worldviews that were popular throughout Mexico and similar areas, places like Guatemala and so on and so forth.
They very much believed that the gods needed human blood to be fed.
That the shedding of human blood is what allowed the gods to be properly fed, allowed the sun to come back up each day.
And because of that, most of the civilizations in the area practice human sacrifice.
Sometimes the sacrifice would be a volunteer sacrifice of somebody who sacrificed their own life for the health of the community.
In other cases, sacrifices became sacrifices of prisoners of war would be sacrificed onto your altar for the sake of providing the proper nutriment for the gods.
These needed to say did not go very well with the people who had been conquered by the Mexica.
They resented being under the boot of these highly militaristic people.
They resented having to pay regularly pay tribute to them.
They resented the fed of the Mexica who sometimes captured their kids as slaves.
They resented the idea that they would capture some other people to be killed in human sacrifice.
That's an important piece of the story because it will feature in now the Spaniards will be able to go after the Mexica.
The Mexica, by the way, they had come, they themselves, the origin stories, that they had come at some point in a few centuries past.
They had migrated from the north.
Nobody knows where the north means northern Mexica or the areas that are modern-day south-west United States, but somewhere up there.
They had moved south.
They had come into an area that was already densely populated and inhabited by very powerful civilization.
They were the last guys on the block.
They were seen as a bunch of barbarians, but more refined at advanced civilizations in the area.
They mainly tolerated them as mercenaries.
They would, the various kingdoms in the Valley of Mexico, hire them as mercenaries in their wars against one another.
That's how the Mexica was slowly able to gain power until they themselves became an important kingdom and started conquering everybody else.
By the time by 1519, the Mexica and power had been around for a while, but their ability to conquer such a huge part of Mexico was a relatively recent phenomenon, just of the last few decades.
So when the Spaniards arrive, one of the things that happened that helped them a whole bunch is that when they land in the southern coast of Mexico and they arrive among Maya people, they get really lucky really quick.
One of the things that happened, and I get into a little bit of the details just to give you a flavor for it, but as I said, much more of these exist if you wanna check out the Porca series.
When they arrive in the southern part of Mexico, they were told by some of the local Maya people that somebody would look like them was already there.
And what Cortes and these guys found out is that there were a couple of men who had the shipwrecked before Spaniards were shipwrecked there, and that survived for the last few years, leaving among the Maya.
So Cortes went to find one of these guys by the name of Aguilar, and Aguilar, you know, Geronimo Aguilar was so happy to be discovered by the Spaniards, he said,
I'm here for 80 years, I'm on the Maya, I can't wait to get back to Spain, I'm so happy, but Cortes was like, that's great and all.
But the important thing is that you speak Maya, which means that I can communicate with these guys and I can get some valuable information about what's going on in Mexico.
Incidentally, there's another story that's really funny, that the second guy from the Spanish expedition that I shipwrecked here before to have survived, you know, all the other people that died before, but the other survivor was a guy by the name of Gonzalo Guerrero.
And when the Spaniards went looking for him saying, hey, we're here to save you, they got a very different reception of the one they got from Aguilar.
Guerrero showed up covering tribal tattoos from head to toe, he was married to a Maya woman, he had three kids.
And so his approach was like, well, thank you guys for coming to say hi, but I'm perfectly at Omir, so goodbye, thank you, say hello to Spain for me.
And the Spaniards couldn't believe it, they're like, what do you mean, how can you give up on Spanish civilization and, you know, good Zalgo Guerrero gone native.
He was perfectly happy being adopted into the tribe, being a member of the tribe, leaving as one of them, he became eventually war captain for the Maya.
And in the years to come, he actually led the Maya resistance against the Spaniards.
So, you know, sometimes we get lost when we talk about the big picture of history, we start focusing on the Spaniards, the Mexica, as if all of these people were thinking with one head.
But as you can tell, you know, you get out to Spaniards, throw them there among the Maya, one of them can't wait to get out, and he's only too happy when Cortes comes to her and quote rescue him.
And the other guy marries a Maya woman, their union gives rise to the first interracial kids on the mainland, you know, in Mexico, and he's happy there and he doesn't want to live.
So, you know, not all Spaniards think alike, not all Mexica alike, individuality is still a big part of history.
Long story short, thanks to Aguilar, Cortes is able to find out a couple of things about the Mexica.
He finds out that, A, these guys have built a big empire, which means they are making a lot of money in tributes from all the people they have defeated.
B, there are a lot of people who hate the Mexica, because they don't like having to pay tribute and have to give up their own people for sacrifice.
These two factors are really good news for Cortes, because that means that, you know, sometimes history books make it sound like, how is it possible that 1500 Spaniards were able to take down an empire of millions of people?
The subtext of that is saying, are in Europeians amazing, they are clearly superior.
The reality is more complicated than that, because what Cortes did is, he started setting up a system of alliances, with a bunch of people who have been defeated by the Mexica wanted to get rid of Mexica domination.
So the reality is that the war for Mexico that will last between 1519 and 1521 is not a war between just a group of Europeans and the Mexica.
Is a war where 90% of the people fighting it will be native?
Mexica one side, but on the Spanish side, well the Spaniards would end up having like 100,000 plus native allies will fight on their side against the Mexica.
So that's an important element to remember in this story.
Those are really going to be the two, if we're to wonder how is it possible for the Spaniards to win?
Well, one vast numbers of natives who are going to join them in order to get rid of the Mexica.
Two diseases, the wild Mexica will be fighting against the Spaniards, and there are quite a few moments when it looks like they are going to win,
but waves of epidemic diseases will wipe out extremely large percentage of the Mexica population.
So after two years of fighting, after lots of beckons, forts and dramatic events, the Spaniards are able to conquer the Mexica empire,
which means the Cortes and the skies will become fabulously wealthy really fast.
Now the native people who are joined Cortes, their calculation would be irrational, the Mexica are awful,
we can ally ourselves with the Spaniards, kick them out, and by awful they weren't too thrilled to be dominated by the Mexica, so this can work out.
The Spaniards can be our pawns to get rid of the Mexica.
What they hadn't calculated on was the fact that the Spaniards were not any better masters than the Mexica had been,
and on top of it that epidemic diseases that the Spaniards brought with them would wipe out the population of native Mexica.
One estimate suggests that there may have been 25 million people in native Mexico, and within a few decades there will be only 1 million left,
which if you do the math, that means some 96% mortality rate over a few decades.
What does that mean? Well that means that it's going to be really hard for native people to set up any kind of resistance to Spanish domination,
when 96% of your people got wiped out.
So that's part of the story for how the Spaniards will come to rule these lands.
A lot of pre-Columbian history, a lot of what we wish we knew about this society,
we don't know because the Spaniards burned the books.
You know, the Mexica were a literate culture as well as the Maya, as well as a few other.
Well that's too bad because the Mexica just burned their books, so we lose so much of the history that we could have known otherwise.
There's basically a replay of the same story in South America.
Just a few years later in the 50th or 50th, the Spaniards will lead an expedition in the area of modern-day Peru,
and they will go after the Inca Empire, which was the other major native empire in the Americas.
And again, similar dynamics and they will conquer there as well.
So in the span of a few years, the two biggest native societies in the Americas
have been taken down by the Spaniards.
Many of the Spaniards arrive after the 15th or 50th.
They keep dreaming that there's another big empire larger than the Inca, larger than the Mexica.
They have this notion of Hildorado, the idea of the city of gold, this place where the wealth of these people is higher than anything,
or Tessa Vranin, or the people who conquered the Inca, but it's a myth.
There is no third big Indian empire, there's nothing on the size of the Inca or the Mexica.
This is now going to prevent a bunch of Spaniards from traveling up and down, north-central and south America, looking for it.
For example, in North America there's an expedition by this Spanish conquistador named De Soto,
who between 1539 and 1543, he landed with his guys in Florida,
made it all the way to Texas.
He got into a conflict with lots of the native societies in the area,
and you know, this will be a disaster for everybody, because a bunch of the Spaniards will die during these fights,
and a bunch of the natives will be introduced to diseases that will kill them in vast numbers.
But there is no big Indian empire.
And this lack of a big Indian empire in North America
will be really the only reason why we speak English today.
Because at there being a big Indian empire, let's say, Wisconsin, or somewhere in the Orcanada or something,
the Spaniards would have found it, they would have conquered it like they had done,
and by the time their power began decreasing,
well, you wouldn't have mattered, because they had a solid foothold also in North America,
they wouldn't have been known for British colonies to come over and set up shop.
The only reason why we have an English-speaking Canada and United States is because there was no big Indian empire in North America.
So the Spaniards are not that interested in taking over.
They have all the land they want in Central and South America,
they didn't want land, they want a quick way to make money.
And in North America, most of the societies here are...
Some of them are very advanced, but they are nowhere near in terms of a mass wealth
what they had found among the Mexica and the Inca.
There are from small-scale hunting and gathering to semi-large-scale agriculture, but it's more or the trouble of fighting them
than it is what you get if you win.
So, Spaniards are not going to expand into North America quite as much.
Incidentally, by the way, about that, the salt expedition, the guy leading the expedition, he himself will die,
the survivors of it will return in 1543, having accomplished nothing.
So, you know, not every time the Spaniards went out for some big expedition, they were successful.
Speaking of what I was telling you about, you know, talking about these Spaniards in the abstract is a little bit of a joke.
It is an example of the differences that could exist among the Spaniards.
There was a famous debate between two priests, one named Bartolomeo de las Casas and another one named Sepulveda.
Who argued radically different views regarding how the Spaniards took three native peoples?
Bartolomeo de las Casas was a harsh critic of the way the Spaniards went about conquering the natives.
He said, you know, we are here supposedly to save them with the gospel and bring them Christianity
and instead our soldiers are raping their women, stealing their gold, murdering indiscriminately.
That's not saving them, this is terrible.
We should reform and treat them however we are supposed to.
Sepulveda on the other end took the attitude of, ah, de las Casas, you are just a big whiner.
These guys are a bunch of barbarians who understand nothing but violence, so shut up and let us do our job.
Both priests were hoping to convince the Spanish king to adopt their position.
Neither the king decided to stay out of it, so by default this was a victory for Sepulveda since he was advocating the status quo.
Whereas de las Casas was asking for a radical change.
But just to show you that not all Spaniards were the same.
The system the Spaniard set up, which will affect Indian life quite a bit, is known as the Incobien de System.
And again the term Incobien deis up there in the power points.
The Incobien de system works something like this.
Depending on rank within the Spanish army, the people who contributed to conquering would be given a plot of land, either bigger or smaller depending on rank.
And not just a plot of land, but you would also be given authority over whatever many natives lived on that plot of land.
So essentially what this was was setting up some sort of feudal structure where Spaniards would be ruling over some large land and all the people living in there.
And these people would essentially become their servants, their slaves.
What this system did was create a mixed society.
Because while the Spaniards definitely held some very strongly racist views toward the natives, they also, there were many more Spanish men than women coming over, so a lot of them started taking native mistresses and having kids with them.
Which will lead to the growth of oil become known as the Mestisos.
The Mestisos were mixed blood born from the union of Spanish fathers with native mothers.
Now clearly in the majority, unlike the Gonzalo Guerrero case I mentioned earlier, the majority of cases were, if not rape, obviously they were not exactly voluntary unions because you have a Spanish lord with a native slave.
How much of a choice do you have to say no?
But you know, that's set up the system that will be popular in Latin America, which is the reason why then eventually Latin America will be largely a mixed society of most everyone in Latin America is a mix of native and Spaniard.
Some people are entirely native, some people are entirely Spaniards, but that's the minority.
And majority of people are Mestisos, they are a mix of both.
And that's because of the way the Spaniards set up this system.
I should mention something here that even though it's true that for the most part the Spaniards didn't push into North America because they didn't find what they wanted, they do it a little bit.
Specifically in the Southwest, in the areas of modern day New Mexico, Arizona, right around the Southwest of modern United States, they started going into the around the 1540s and they ran into a series of tribes that they referred to as the Pueblos.
The Pueblos were tribes like the Hopi, the Zuni, people like that.
Tewa, bunch of others, who lived in permanent villages, they were likely the descendants of the Anazazi who had been abeted the region much earlier, you may recall them from lecture number one.
And they were not super-reach empires, but they had large agricultural societies with big villages with surplus of agricultural products.
So the Spaniards figured, well that's good enough to conquer, we can conquer these guys, enslave them, we leave off them, and then we can finance further expedition into North America from here, and we have a decent chunk of land, not so bad.
Occasionally the tribes tried to rebel, for example in 1598 at a place called the Comapuevlo, there was an attempt at rebelling and kicking out the Spaniards because nobody wanted to be their slave, but the Spaniards squashed the rebellion in blood, by the time they were able to take down the rebellion, they grabbed every male in the village and cut off their right foot.
The message being, don't even think about rebelling against us, that's not a good idea.
Pre-Blo people have been inabiting the area for centuries, they have been living as farmers in the south-west for an extremely long time.
And Spanish colonization over them, Spanish rule over them was brutal, the Spaniards were, they would regularly burn at the stake, anybody was found practicing the older religion, they had all to convert to Catholicism or else, being ruled by the Spaniards in the 1500s, it was really bad news.
But the fact that the Spaniards were so harsh led to an event, and I'm going a little bit ahead chronologically with our story, I'm gonna go back to the 1500s after this, but I wanna tell you a story that dates from the late 1600s, because it involves Spanish colonization.
What happened with the Pre-Blos is that after over 100 years of Spanish domination, by the 1670s, people were fed up.
They were fed up for multiple reasons, but one of them was the fact that the southwest was entering a period of drought.
Why is this important? Because drought was very much a big deal in Pueblo religion.
Much of their religion involved praying to and making deals with spirits, they were supposed to bring the rain.
As long as you did the ceremony for the spirits, the spirits were happy and they would bring rain.
Now you can no longer practice the ceremonies, because if you do the Spaniards burn at the stake, and there's no rain.
In the Pueblo mind, this was not a coincidence, this was not a, oh look at one strange thing, it was a logical conclusion, if you don't do the ceremonies for the spirits, of course rain will not come.
And then we're all going to starve.
So the way the Pueblo saw it is we have to rebel, we don't have an option, if we don't rebel we'll die of starvation, so we might as well take our chances.
So in 1680 they started the most successful rebellion ever staged by a native group in North America against a European group.
Groups of Pueblo, and here is they learned something from their previous efforts.
They learned that if one village rebels, the Spaniards can easily squash them.
But if all the villagers could rebel at the same time, there may be a different story.
So the Pueblos, the leaders of these revolts sent out runners to visit every single village throughout New Mexico and Arizona,
bringing news that on such, such day we are going to rebel.
They would bring these ropes in which they had not tied a bunch of knots.
And each day you would untie a knot so that everybody would know exactly what the day to rebel was, everybody would be on the same page.
And they did.
So on this one day in 1680, a bunch of different villages all rose up in rebellion started killing the Spaniards in their village.
And they killed all in all about 400 Spaniards and they sent many more packing and running away for their south.
This was their big victory. This is a huge deal in Pueblo memory.
Even to this day there's a funny story involved in 1976 to celebrate the 200 years of the declaration of independence.
A bunch of art galleries in New Mexico sponsored the idea of let's do an art exhibition on the theme of independence.
One guy that they asked to do a work on independence, one of their paintings was this Hoppe guy.
So when he thought independence he wasn't thinking 1776, he was thinking 1680 Pueblo Revolt.
So the painting that he turned in was an image of a comma Pueblo with the church being destroyed, with the priest being hanged on the side.
To him that was what freedom looked like.
That's what independence looked like, the day when the Pueblos were able to kill the Spaniards and take their land back.
The Pueblo Revolt has two huge legacies.
The first one to affect all native people, which is for the first time since the Spaniards show up, thousands of Spanish horses fell into Indian ants.
And so the Pueblos traded them to other tribes and before you know it they started a horse revolution because as I mentioned in the past there were no horses in North America
that had been domesticated. You know they may have been thousands of years before but they were never domesticated, they went extinct.
So horses showed up again when the Spaniards showed up.
And now for the first time native said access to all these horses.
So very quickly post Pueblo Revolt, horses were traded from tribes to tribe and many tribes were able to adapt their lifestyle to adopt horses into it, which should make them much more mobile, much more vulnerable.
And they were more effective, better a warfare, a huge revolution in native life, made possible by the Pueblo Revolt.
The other legacy is for the Pueblos.
What happens is 12 years later in 1692 the Spaniards are able to reconquer the Pueblos, but they will do so under very different circumstances.
They understand that if they squashed the Pueblos this guy will keep rebelling and fighting.
So they are going to take a different approach to colonization. They are going to rule with a much more gentle hand.
You know you are under as a so you still pay tribute and you know we leave off you.
But if you want to practice your religion behind closed doors just fake it.
You know just make it look like you are a good Catholic on Sundays and then we are not going to look too closely at what you do.
Which means that despite being colonized again the Pueblos were able now to keep their culture alive, to make it survive down to this day.
And this was strictly the outcome of the Pueblo Revolt. By doing that they were able to make it happen.
So this is a nutshell, I mean there is obviously much more to tell and I am kind of sketching the big picture here for you guys.
But as I mentioned you know you want to go deeper you can do for example check out the 4-par series on Istrion Fire.
There is a lot more information about native societies in Mexico and all of that stuff.
But for the time being I wanted to sketch at least a little bit about the Spanish native interactions in places like the south west in Mexico and so on.
So I hope this clarifies things for you guys a little bit.
And with that we wrap things up for today.
