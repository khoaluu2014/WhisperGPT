Ready to roll with lecture number four. So far we have looked at the interaction between native peoples and Spaniards.
In the latter part of the 1500s this is going to change, as in other European groups will begin to make their way to primarily to North America.
What happens is in 1588 Spain loses a war in Europe that will break their monopoly on the oceans.
So far the best that other European powers could do is to just engage in piracy and try to steal from the Spaniards the gold that they had stolen from the Aztecs and the Incas.
But now after the Spain no longer is mastered over the ocean, other European powers will start sending people to the Americas in greater numbers.
The main ones will be England, France and curiously enough Holland which is rather weird when you think about it because Holland, the whole country is about the size of the room I'm sitting in now and 30 people living it.
But if you've ever been to Holland the average person is like 12 feet tall I swear they are giant so I can see how they would colonize the rest of the world.
But in any case the Dutch are not going to play an important role early on but not nearly as big as the French and English.
The Dutch will start colonize for example modern day New York originally started out as a Dutch settlement called New Amsterdam.
But eventually the Dutch will be kicked out by the English during fighting in the 1600s.
So primarily what we're going to see is the English and the French coming to North America and they will be the ones interacting with native peoples.
The cultural environment in Europe in the 1500s was sort of ripe for people to want to get out.
The Protestant Reformation with Martin Luther in the early 1500s led to never ending wars of religions being fought over which religion was the right religion to follow.
In fact if you have a Catholic Christian or Catholic Catholic you would have Catholics persecuting Protestants within Catholic countries, Protestants persecuting Catholics and Catholic countries.
To make it even a little messier you had Protestants persecuting other Protestants in Protestant countries because you know Protestants weren't just one single movement.
They often hated each other as much as they hated Catholics so moral of the story Europe turns into a bloodbath for a while where there's this war after war after war religious violence rules the land which makes it rather appealing for a lot of people to want to get out and check out what's going on in the Americas.
The French, the three main powers, the Spaniards, the French and the English will handle their interaction with native people in completely different ways.
So far we have seen how the Spaniards, mainly they would conquer native societies, they would incorporate native peoples as part of their society but in a hierarchical kind of way, in a master slave type of relationship.
So yes they add the kids with them, yes they will give rise to multi ethnic societies but it's based on conquest, there's forced conversions involved and all of that.
The French will adopt a completely different approach.
The French will never really come as a colonial power to take over massive amounts of land in the Americas.
One of the main primary purposes for which the French will come to the Americas will be to be engaged in the fourth raid.
That is, there was a lot of demand in Europe for the force of certain animals.
They were found in the Americas but were sorely lacking in Europe because of they had wiped out so many of their forests that there was not enough supply to satisfy the demand for force.
So many young French men came to the Americas to be active in the fourth raid, get forced from North America, ship them to Europe, make a profit, make some money that way.
Now that was a very distant second in terms of money making enterprises compared to the Spaniards conquering straight up empires but it was the next best thing.
So quite a few French people came into the land with that goal in mind.
Because this was their goal, this will shape their interactions with the tribes in the North East, like the Great Lakes area, which is one of the areas where the French will be most active, but the boundary between Mother and Canada and the United States.
Because the reality is that the French needed Indian friendship.
They couldn't afford to conquer them or to alienate them or to anger them in any other way.
They needed native people to want to trade with them.
Otherwise there would be no fourth raid.
The reason why they needed it and they couldn't just enslave people is that you can't really well, you can enslave somebody that you put to work in the fields because you can keep an eye on them.
But you can't really enslave somebody if then you hand them a gun and say go off into the forest and bring me back some force.
It's obviously that doesn't work very well, does it?
So the reality is that the French needed Indian friendship.
And as a result they behave accordingly.
So many of the young French men were willing to learn Indian languages, to visit the tribes in their homes, to intermarry with them.
And unlike the intermarriage between Spaniards and natives, which was more often than not forced intermarriages where native people were killed.
But clearly in an inferior status and not much in a position to say no, the intermarriage is between French and natives where between willing partners were both side wanted to be part of the union.
So these led to the creation of what were known as the metis, which is basically the French term for the kids mixed blood.
In this case he refers to the kids born from the union of French fathers and Indian mothers.
Sort of like mestizo in Latin America, but again with different power dynamics involved there.
In some cases the French so adapted to life in their wives' tribes that for all intents and purposes they went native.
They became part of the tribe.
They may have been ethnically French but they were becoming sort of the quote unquote white Indians.
In some cases they kept a foot in both words where they would be comfortable trading in the villages and hanging out with native people.
But they would also keep a foot then in European word and be able to bring their force back and all of that kind of stuff.
So for the most part the interaction between native peoples in the north east and the French was more positive
than the interaction between any native people and Europeans.
This was one where both sides wanted to be part of this trade.
This doesn't mean that there weren't exception to this rule.
For example if you were from a tribe that was tribal enemies with one of the tribes that the French were allied to.
Then you'll probably hate the French because they are giving guns and military support to your tribal enemies.
So they are with one native tribe against another native tribes.
So for example the French got into quite a few wars with members of the Iroquois Confederacy
because many of them were doing business either with the Dutch or with the English so there was some struggle with that.
They also got into wars with... there was at least one case where most of the French presence in North America was around the Great Lakes
and that was Fort Red Arab.
But there was a bit of a French colony going in the area of modern-day Louisiana.
This happened in the 1700s and unlike the French living in the Great Lakes
the ones who went to Louisiana they wanted land.
They weren't there to trade. There was no fort trade in Louisiana. They wanted land.
Because of that they did not need Indian friendship if any native people were competition for the same land.
So they got into a conflict with a tribe named the Natchets, spelled N-A-T-C-H-E-Z again N-A-T-C-H-E-Z
and basically wiped them out in the early 1700s.
Now these remained the exception to the rule for the most part French native contacts were fairly positive
but for the most part means...
not every time, you know, usually.
But there definitely were exceptions to this.
The story of the English native contact is different from both the Spanish native contact and the French native contact.
With the English it's a different type of story. The English will come here to take over land.
So unlike the French, usually, and like the Spanish, like the Spaniards usually, the English want land.
So they will get into wars with native tribes.
Unlike the Spaniards, they are not going to be that interesting converting native peoples or in intermarrying with them.
They just want the land.
And the sooner the natives go away preferably dying off somewhere, the happier they are so they can step in and take over the land.
So that's different from both the French and the Spaniards.
The first attempt at an English colony was in an island of the course of Virginia in the mid-1580s.
What happened here, this one will become known as the lost colony because what happens is that these...
you know, the colonies there, they arrive, they realize that it was a lot harder to make a living that they had...
compared to what they had expected.
So one of the early governors of this colony has to go back to England to get some both supplies and more people to come help the colonies stay functional.
Keep in mind this colony is only, you know, I remember correctly, it was barely over 100 people.
By the time the governor managed to come back to the colony, like two or three years have gone by,
and by the time he gets back there in 1590, the settlement is gone.
You know, the people are, there's nobody left.
They are the only clue that he can find, you know, he doesn't see any sign of violence, I think.
Probably nothing horrible happened here, it doesn't look like they were the victims of a native attack or anything.
But the only clue he finds is scratched into the bark of a tree.
He finds the name, this name Croatoan, which is the name of a friendly native village a few miles away.
So the governor figure, okay, I don't know what that means, but I'm gonna go to this village and see if they know something about it.
But when he gets back into his ship and try to make it to the village, they hit a series of storm one after another,
until eventually the captain of the ship decided, I'm sorry, but we need to go back because this is too dangerous.
And so the governor will leave the country without ever finding out what happened to the members of this first English colony.
There are all sorts of theories about what happened.
Some of them will say the most prevailing theory is that the surviving members of this colony,
finding themselves running out of food and in kind of dire straits, they decided to try to get adopted by members of a native tribe.
And eventually they will intermarrier with them, they mix with them until there, which is one of the reason why many of the natives in that part of the country,
even years later, had much lighter features than many of the natives elsewhere.
If this is true, and it's a big if, you know, there's debate regarding what happened, but if this is true, it's interesting because it shows you a couple of things.
One, something about native cultures.
The native cultures, you know, they were not, they were not there ready to embrace everybody with open arms.
However, they did not have the same degree of racism that characterized certain other cultures, and definitely European culture at this time.
For example, they very much were rooted in a worldview where there are guys and they are guys, and they are not sympathy for people from elsewhere in that sense.
However, people from elsewhere could be adopted into the tribe.
You know, skin color was no barrier to that.
They liked you enough, it doesn't matter, you know, white people, black people, people from Mexico, people from all over will be adopted into native tribes,
and they will be treated like anyone else.
They will have the same rights and privileges as any other tribal member.
The key question is whether they like you or not, and whether they want you to be a part of their tribe or not.
If they do, they are welcome, and you are in.
And so this is interesting because it's possible that the survivors of this English colony actually led to the creation of the first interracial community between English and natives in the new world,
which by the way will be a major exception to the pattern where usually the English will no one to have anything to do with natives.
The next spot where the English will land, still in Virginia, this time on the mainland, not in Ireland, and will happen in 1607 at Jamestown.
Now into the desire of Virginia was inhabited by members of the Po'at'an Confederacy.
The names are spelled out in the PowerPoint.
The Po'at'an Confederacy was a coalition of some 30-old tribes who lived by hunting and gathering but also by farming.
And when the English first showed up at Jamestown, they were clearly struggling.
The early time, a bunch of them starved to that because they were not quite, they didn't know how to make a living in this new land,
when to plant, how much to plant.
So there was an interesting story when members of the Po'at'an Confederacy came up and handed out food to those members of the Jamestown colony were starving.
And by starving I mean really starving.
There were some of these guys that there were a couple of cases where some of the surviving settlers in Jamestown dug up the bodies of their friends who had died before them to eat them.
You know, when you're munching on your dead friends bones, that's usually not a sign that things are going very well.
And it's in this context that the Po'at'an show up and bring food, which seems like a pretty cool thing if you're starving that saves your life.
But there's something interesting here that tells you a lot of why the English and the natives are not going to get along very well.
From the diaries of one of the Jamestown settlers, he wrote this thing.
He wrote, if it had not pleased God to put a terror into the savage's heart, we would have all perished by those wild and cruel pagans being in the weak state that we were.
What that means is, you know, the way this guy makes sense of what just happened is that clearly these people couldn't be good people.
Even if they saved you from certain death, they must be bad people.
And why must they be bad people? Well, because they are pagans. They're not Christian.
So right off the bat, we know they are bad people.
But they just saved you from certain death.
Okay, that complicates things a little bit, but we know they are bad people and nothing is going to change my mind about it.
So I guess God must have scared them into being nice for a moment, but we know that deep down they are bad people.
Well, you can understand that with that kind of worldview in place, they aren't going to be friends for very long.
The second, you know, what the Poetan had planned was they were hoping to bring members of the Jamestown colony back up to strength.
Because even though they were weird and pale and didn't know how to make a living, they did have access to some really cool tools and metal and steel and guns.
So maybe they could become one more villa just part of the Poetan Confederacy.
But they quickly realized as members of Jamestown gained strength and did not even need the Poetan help no more,
then they had no interest in being friends with them or being part of a coalition with native tribes.
So seeing started getting a bit edgy.
And one of the things that happened is that during this context, members of the Jamestown settlement kidnapped the daughter of the Poetan leader,
young woman by the name of Pocahontas.
Now Pocahontas, there was a history already.
John's Meat was one of the leaders of Jamestown colony, wrote that initially during some of the early contest,
members of the Poetan Confederacy had captured him, they were ready to kill him when the daughter of the chief saved him from certain death.
You know, if you guys have all watched Disney Pocahontas, you know what I'm talking about.
Problem is historical, it's very debated whether any of that happened.
You know, John's Meat had a reputation for making up tall tales left and right.
He told the same story about being rescued by some woman in many different parts of the world.
There's no other testimony that this happened, so it's possible that he made it up.
What he didn't make up is that there was indeed a Pocahontas, who was the daughter of the Poetan leader, that much was true.
And at this time she got kidnapped by the English, who used there as a poem, you know, that way they kept demanding more land from the Poetan and the Poetan who desitated to attack because they had the daughter of the chief with them.
While she was kidnapped, by the way, one more thing about Pocahontas and, you know, if you guys have watched the movies, the way it's presented, there's this love story with John's Meat, all of it, well, that's all made up.
If indeed she had saved John's Meat, which is a big gift, but let's assume even in John's Meat account there's no hint at romance or anything, even because it would have been weird.
Pocahontas was not the super hot woman of Disney fame, or at least as hot as a cartoon can be, but you know what I'm saying.
She would have been a younger, probably 10, 11, 12 years old, something like that, really young.
And John's Meat himself doesn't hit that there's any kind of romantic feelings there, none of that.
What does happen to is that as she becomes a teenager in the full lane years, Pocahontas marry a guy from her own tribe, then she get kidnapped by the English, while she's kidnapped by the English, she will end up marrying a guy by the name of John Rolf.
We have no idea whether she wanted to marry this guy or whether she was forced into it.
I mean, it's a weird setup to marry a guy who's essentially one of your kidnappers.
So, who knows?
Did she wash her wheel and wash her not?

Either case, she did marry this guy, eventually went back with him to England, and as they were about to get ready to travel back to Virginia, she cooked some European disease and died by the age of 22.
Which is a horrible story, you know, Disney, I wish the universe was run by Disney screenwriters because it would be such a more pleasant place.
Real history is terrible, I mean, what kind of history is that?
You know, they kidnap you, you go back to England, catch some nasty disease and die at 22.
That doesn't sound like a Disney movie, but in any case.
Once with the death of Pocahontas, everything changes because the relationship between the settlers at Jamestown and the Poetan is going to get much worse.
By the way, let me say something real quick before we discuss what happened at Jamestown.
The marriage between Pocahontas and the English guy was very much an exception to the rule, there will be typical of English colonization.
Unlike the Spaniards and unlike the French, the English will try not to intermarry with native peoples.
Many of the English colonies will even pass laws prohibiting their own members from going to live with native people.
And, you know, there are a couple of reasons for it. One that many people in the English colonies came as indenture servants.
People were being essentially were slaves, but their slavery would end after a few years.
Problem was most of them never saw freedom because they would die of being overworked before their time was up.
So for many of them it made perfect sense to try to escape and who leave among native people, where if they were like by the tribe, they would be adopted with the same rights and privileges.
So English colonies passed three close to prevent that.
Also they didn't like very much that very few natives ever wanted to live with Europeans, but a bunch of their own people wanted to live with natives, that did not sound like a complimentary thing,
regarding the relative health of each culture.
You know, there was something written by French author who wrote about native culture.
He said, there must be in their social bond something singularly captivating and far superior to anything to be boasted of among us.
For thousands of Europeans are Indians and we have no examples of even one of those Aborigines having from choice become Europeans.
Here these guys are referring to the fact that it did happen quite a bit, that Europeans would end up living in Indian villages.
And that's something that really disturbed a lot of other Europeans who saw it as a betrayal of some kind.
When he was trying to influence this to say, noticing the same pattern, he said, no European who has tasted savage life can afterwards bear to live in our societies.
So again it shows you that while native people may have been far from perfect, they did not have any kind of racial boundary that prevented people of different skin colors to be adopted into the tribe.
Sometime white adoptees or black adoptees could even become tribal leaders.
In our case, that just being the point, not a whole lot of intermarriage between natives and the English.
What we do see on the other hand is the fact that the relationship between the settlers at Jamestown and the Powhatang gets really ugly really fast.
In 1622, full on the war began.
The war will begin and stop and start again and begin and stop and start again and roughly with lots of interaction, there will be a war between 1622 and 1644.
And these war follows the pattern of a lot of wars between natives and Europeans, which is usually starts out with native swinging and doing well.
And the longer the conflict continues, the more Europeans begin to gain an upper end until eventually they win.
And why is that?
Well, for one, the longer the timeframe, the more people would have time to, the more diseases will have chance to spread and kill a whole bunch of natives weakening them.
Also, each native person killed, that could not be replaced, you kill a European and more come from Europe.
They burn your crops, well, you have nothing to eat. You burn their crops, they get more food coming from Europe.
So time was very much on the European side.
And so eventually by 1644, settlers at Jamestown are able to crush the power of the Powhatang Confederacy and conquer a big chunk of land.
The English will also set up a second center of colonization, a little bit further north in the area of modern-day New England.
Their first permanent settlement there was in 1620 at Plymouth.
This is the classic story that I have heard a million times about the pilgrims coming from England, settling down in the new ward.
And again, these guys are another to trade or for their their to start a new life.
Many of them were members of a Protestant minority known as the Puritans.
And the Puritans were, think of them as the religious fundamentalist of their day, they were extremely strict in a matter of morality.
They considered the Anglican Church way too relaxed for their taste.
They saw corruption everywhere they turned.
They considered the popularity of the theater of London, the kind of thing that the same way as hardcore conservative look at all the wood today.
They saw it as, you know, there's a historian say this kind of as a joke, but it's partially true, partially a joke.
He said a Puritan was somebody who was constantly obsessed over the fact that someone, somewhere, somehow, maybe having a new life.
And they wanted to be able to start a new life in the Americas where they would be the majority and they could shape society according to their worldview, not be a minority in somebody else's world.
The scenario they encountered was a lot easier than the scenario than the people in Jamestown in the UK.
They were a lot easier than the people in Jamestown in the UK than the people in the UK.
The scenario they encountered was a lot easier than the scenario than the people in Jamestown in Virginia encountered.
Because, well, initially it was kind of the same because much like the people in Jamestown, the people that Plymouth show up, they run out of resources really fast and these thanks to the help of some native peoples, they are able to survive initially.
So you kind of have a carbon copy of the same thing.
It is where things change, however, where you see some differences.
Unlike the scenario in Virginia where you were facing the Poetan coalition, where a bunch of tribes were allied with one another, in New England there's a bunch of tribes who are all rivals with one another.
So the Poetans will play a very effective divide and conquer game, or they would ally themselves with one tribe against another, get rid of the tribe, then move on to the next one and keep switching alliances until they could clear out a lot of the main tribes from the area.
For example, in the 1630s, in 1637, along with some of their native allies, they staged an attack on the Pequot and basically wiped them out.
A few survived, but the Pequot was a tribe that were destroyed, they were completely wiped out as a result of it.
There's quite a bit of information about this in American Holocaust by David Standard.
They played this game for a good chunk of the 1600s, until eventually they started turning on their former allies.
One of the tribes that they were allied with, initially the very first tribe to have helped them when they first arrived, was this tribe known as the Wampanoag, again for the precise spelling, you can check the lecture notes on the powerpoint.
The Wampanoag, you know, you hear always the story about the first Thanksgiving, and there's some truth to that, in the sense that the Wampanoag and the Pequotans did have an alliance, probably something like the tale of the first Thanksgiving of this allied group coming together to have a big Thanksgiving feast.
It's something that is probably rooted in history.
The part that we tend to forget on our, you know, great school Thanksgiving plays is that the same people who are sitting down to have Thanksgiving dinner together are the ones who are going to brutally murder each other, not too many years later.
And I don't know, maybe your family's nicer than that, and that's not what happens, but that's definitely what happens in this case.
The Wampanoag began to be annoyed with their former allies, because the Pequotans were demanding constantly more and more land, they were taking more and more land, and the Wampanoag were not too thrilled with that.
So eventually, when a Wampanoag man by the name of Metacomet, spelled M-T-A-C-O-M-E-T, Metacomet, the Pequotans would refer to him as King Philip, because Metacomet became the head of the Wampanoag tribe, and the Pequotans figure, okay, Metah, what?
You have a weird name, so how about we just call you Philip, and they are a chief, so that's kind of like a king, so we'll just call you King Philip.
In any case, Metacomet was not quite as willing to negotiate with the Pequotans as his brother before him or his father before him.
Metacomet added it, he felt like these guys are pushing us against the wall, they are constantly mistaking our kindness for weakness, we are done with this.
So as tension was built in up between the two sides, something happened when a Wampanoag man, who had actually been working as a spy for the English, was found dead, his body was found dead in a lake, in a frozen lake.
Nearby, the Pequotans found three Wampanoag warriors, so they arrested them, put them on trial, and killed them.
The Wampanoag's were furious about it, because they felt like first you have no rights to do that.
Second, the Wamp, our warriors barely even spoke any English, they couldn't really defend themselves in court, this court was a joke, this wasn't a trial, and even if they did do it, it would be a Wampanoag man killing another Wampanoag man, you have no business interfering with this.
So that was sort of the last drop for Metacomet, he decided to gather up as many allies as possible, and in light of that, just start attacking the Pequotans.
This is the beginning of what become known as the King Felipor, which will last from 1674 through 1676.
The war will be brutal for everybody involved, a bunch of English towns will be destroyed, all in all some 2,500 English people will be killed in the fight, which is really a considerable number when you take into account that the whole population of New England was in a few tens of thousands.
But as bad as it was for the English, it was even worse for the Wampanoag and their allies, because the tide of the war started turning, the Pequotans were able to convince a few tribes to actually join their side, so there would be native people fighting on both sides of the war, and Metacomet himself will actually be killed by another native person who was on the side of the Pequotans.
So by 1676, the whole thing is done and over with.
The war ends, and it's going to be another big success for the English being able to conquer a big chunk of land and defeat many of the tribes in the process.
Something that happened at the exact same time that I think I should mention briefly was something that I was happening in the other major center of English domination, which was Virginia,
and was known as the Bacon Rebellion.
Bacon Rebellion referred to a guy by the name of Nataniel Bacon, who led this rebellion against the central government in Jamestown.
Now, on the surface, the rebellion sounds kind of noble.
It was poor white people joining with poor black people to, you know, against the central government in Jamestown.
You know, it sounds like a story of good oppressed people fighting for their rights.
It gets a little uglier, so when you start seeing the role that natives played into this, because the reason why these poor white people and poor black people were wanting to fight against the government was because the government had signed some peace treaties with native tribes in the area.
And they weren't very happy about it, because their only chance to get out of poverty was doing what other people had made money had done, which was push west, steal some Indian land, and make money in that way.
If now you couldn't push west because there was a peace treaty going on with the tribes, well, now that was a real problem.
So, you know, in this light, the rebellion looks a lot less pleasant because you have poor white people and poor black people joining together because they are mad over the fact that they are denied the right to steal more Indian land.
The rebellion will be squashed, but it's kind of a wake-up call to the fact that this kind of tension will remain throughout the history of the English colonies and later in early American society.
One thing that we should keep in mind is that not all the English were not all the same.
Even when we say Christianity or the impact of Christianity on the relation between Europeans and natives, even that wasn't all the same.
You know, the Puritan approach to religion was a very conflictual one.
They had all this series of biblical passages to justify the taking of Indian land,
all this very violent rhetoric about holy war and so on.
And they were very Christian and very much believed in it, but also very Christian and very much believed in it were the Quakers.
The Quakers were also Protestant, but their interpretation of Christianity was radically different.
They had a much more mellow, pacifist, nonviolent interpretation,
which led to considerably better relations with native peoples.
You know, they would only, when they started settling Pennsylvania because the Quakers and the Puritans did not get along at all.
When the Quakers were denied a spittariate in Puritan villages and they had to set up their own colonies in Pennsylvania,
they made sure to buy land from native tribes, pay in a fair price in such a way that they wouldn't be grievances or reasons for fighting down the road.
So, it's interesting to see how people were influenced by Christianity, but in radically different ways.
Some people made them more aggressive and more willing to take Indian land.
Other people were more mellow and because of Christianity wanted to treat native people fairly.
So, it's interesting how it can work both ways.
Speaking of Christianity, the French were in a weird position because whereas the Indian people were not interested in Christianity,
the French were not interested in converting natives for the most part,
and whereas the Spaniards could convert native by force since they conquered them,
the French wanted to convert natives, but they had not conquered them so they couldn't do it by force.
So, they would have to send missionaries as part of the fort raid.
And missionaries were some native people responded very well to missionaries and converted.
Some native people liked some of the missionary ideas, but in their mind there was no point converting,
they would just borrow some Christian ideas and mix them with their own religion.
In classing, inclusive fashion, they felt no need to abandon one religion to adopt another.
They figured if one religion is a good thing, two, even better.
Others, other natives were completely hostile to missionaries and really didn't like their influence.
One group that, not always, by no stretch of the imagination,
but often was hostile to missionary activities where women in native society in the North East.
And it doesn't take a genius to figure out why because women in North East and societies among natives,
usually enjoyed a fairly high degree of independence.
They could choose who they married or they didn't, they could own property, they could divorce,
they could do a lot of things that English women could not do at this time,
or most other European women could not do at this time.
And partially so, the activities of missionaries bother native women because, you know,
start with the whole tale of the Judeo-Christian tradition.
Now the first woman, Eve, is the one that disobeys God and then, as a result of it,
human beings are kicked out of the Garden of Eden.
And one of the punishment for all women afterwards, according to the Bible,
is that women will be now subservient to men.
So, you know, Christianity very much reinforce the idea of patriarchy.
And this patriarchal match just shows up in Christianity over and over again, you know,
simple in the New Testament says, I permit no woman to teach or have authority over men.
She's to keep silent.
The words of a bunch of early Church Fathers are pretty harsh when it comes to gender roles.
And even guys like Martin Luther also, you know, not just Catholics in that sense,
or even Protestants push the same type of gender roles, which is basically an extremely male dominated society.
I mean, to give you an idea of the insane disparity in gender roles, there was an actual English law,
that was referred to as the rule of thumb, that specified how you could properly beat up your wife legally.
And of course, every good husband beats up their wives to keep them in line.
And we understand that sometimes you don't want to use your hands because you can get, break your hand or something.
So it's okay to use a stick, but you can only use a stick that is as thick as your thumb or less.
If you're doing that, you're a good husband.
If he's thicker than your thumb, well, then you're just mean and that's wrong.
I mean, when you have actual laws breaking down how to legally beat your wife, that's a sign that the gender roles are pretty skilled.
In any case, so that's as far as missionary go.
As far as the fourth trade in general, you know, we discussed the fourth trade for a little bit, but let's go into it a little more.
What Europeans wanted was pretty clear.
They wanted the force of certain animals, anything from beaver to deer to a few animals that would be traded for clothing and brooch,
they would be used in the clothing industry in Europe.
What native people wanted out of the fourth trade were mostly goods made of metal, guns, knives, axes, needles, things like that.
Now, natives had the same kind of object, you know, they had axes, they had needles there.
But of course, you know, if you try to sew some clothing with a needle made from the bone of an animal, it's not quite as effective as if you do it with a steel needle.
You can use a stone axe to cut a tree and make canoe out of it, but with a steel axe, the job is much easier, much faster and more effective.
So the fact that native people had not discovered metalology, whereas Europeans did, that was a big element in the fourth trade.
They really liked those things.
One problem the Europeans said in the fourth trade, though, is that native society were built for subsistence, not to make money.
There was no money per se.
It was like, well, so you want to trade as long as you need some stuff.
But the thing is, you know, after you've traded enough, you made no one to trade no more for a while because, okay, I got my guns, I got my ammo, I got my axe, I got all the tools I wanted, I got them.
We're done. I don't need to keep hunting over and over.
Well, that was a problem for the third trade because they wanted to keep the profits rolling in.
So one item that was introduced to try to break down the cycle of subsistence was alcohol.
Because like any good drug, alcohol is one of the things that if when you develop a taste, you want constantly more.
So the way it was often introduced, you know, Europeans would trade with their native trading partners and then at the end of the trade, they'd say, hey, just because I value guys so much.
Here is a free bottle of whiskey for you.
And the next time around, these guys would say, hey, by the way, that stuff you gave us not bad. Do you have any more of it?
And now you start charging them for it. But you charge them little. You don't want to scare them off.
Until they become more and more hooked and then more and more you can start up in the price.
Until alcohol itself become a major part of the fourth trade.
Now the fourth trade was one of those institutions that was benign in nature in the sense that nobody put a gun to your head and said you have to engage in the fourth trade.
You know, both sides, men and, you know, the men, the women, the natives, the Europeans, they all entered in the fourth trade willingly.
And the fourth trade served was an interesting word because that was the place where people exchange trading goods, they exchange ideas, that was intermarriage.
The culture, European cultures and native cultures, very much mixed in the world of the fourth trade.
So it's a very interesting institution in that sense.
But when you look at them in the long term, there were definitely some negative side effects to the fourth trade.
The first one is obvious is that if you go out hunting, day in and day out, you're no longer hunting with a knight to conserve the resources because you want to make sure that their food stays here after year.
If you until the time end up over hunting and you kill animals and the animals at a faster rate than they can reproduce.
So environmental exploitation is definitely a legacy of the fourth trade.
Well, now if you're a native tribe, you have a problem because you've become fully dependent on the fourth trade, yet you have no force left to trade for it because you have wiped out most of the animals in the woods, in around, in the hunting grounds.
So what can you do? What can you do? Well, you remember that the tribe, the fourth or west, they haven't traded much yet.
So their hunting grounds are still stocked with animals.
And they don't have guns because they haven't traded with Europeans. You have guns and no animals to hunt.
It's a match made in heaven, so now you remember you don't like them that much to begin with.
You invade their lands to try to have access to their hunting ground.
So the other consequence that go hand in hand with environmental destruction is an increase in intertribal warfare.
I mean, natives fought before this time, but they fight considerably more afterwards as a result of these rivalries that are increased by the politics of the fourth trade.
So there's a whole series of wars that we're not going to get into, but different tribes almost wiping each other out.
For example, the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy went with the vengeance against some of the rivals, such as the Urons.
And all of these wars were really tied to the fourth trade.
One of the things that happened at this point is that the politics of the fourth trade got really messy,
because you have some tribes that may be allied with the French and other tribes that are allied with English for traders who are going to see the profits in the fourth trade and want to get into it, or maybe Dutch for traders.
Each European group fighting on the side of their tribal allies, and then any one of them, Europeans or natives, could be ready to break alliances,
allied themselves with the other side, switch back and forth.
So it's a messy political context in which different tribes are all jocking for position, different European groups are jocking for position, all trying to get the best deal they can.
Couple of other consequences of the third trade. Of course, diseases will be spread along the same trade routes as trade goods would be bartered.
The status of women tended to decrease as the two main activities of the third trade, hunting and warfare, were usually male activities, so the status of men increased a bit.
The status of older leaders declined since most of the hunting and wars was done by younger leaders, so there was a younger generation of natives who started taking power long before you would have been able to get into it.
So those are some of the changes that emerged as a result of the fourth trade.
Now keep in mind, by the early 1700s, all these dramatic transformations were describing were only happening at the edge of the continent, because the bulk of North American continent was still completely in Indian hands.
The English, the French, they were all relatively close to the coast. Most of North America, majority of natives had never seen a white person yet.
That was going to change soon, but that was still true at the end of the 1600s, early 1700s.
One place away from the East Coast, where we start seeing European presence early on, will be in California in the 1700s.
It is what happened in California. In California there was a major diversity there.
There were lots of different tribes, all hunters and gatherers by the way, however very different when it came to languages, culture, traditions.
Primarily they were focused on fishing and gathering that was their economy.
And they have been visited by the Spaniards in the 1500s, but the Spaniards realized, these guys are all the hunters and gatherers.
There is no wealth for us to steal, so who cares about California, we'll stay out of it.
In the 1700s however, they changed their mind, and they start building a series of missions that go from San Diego all the way up to San Francisco.
For a total of 21 missions.
The reason why they start building the missions is really nothing to do with religion, religion was kind of an excuse.
The reason for the mission is that Europeans didn't recognize native title to the land, they only recognize each other title to the land.
So what happened was the Russian fortrators had been coming from Russia into Alaska
and then making their way south, planting the flag along the way and claiming land.
So the Spaniards were thinking, hmm, the Russians are getting a little too close to our possessions in what's modern day Mexico.
We should create a bit of a buffer zone before the Russians get knocked in on our door.
So the Spaniards built the missions to really just to stop Russian expansion.
In fact, if you notice the last one of the missions, the most northern one of all, stops just within a few miles from the southernmost Russian fort.
They were really planting the flag against one another to claim the land before the other one could.
If you have grown up in California, the missions have this kind of romanticized history that's usually told about them.
I forget, I think it's 4th grade, 5th grade, something like that.
They have you do the mission project in grade school, people visit the missions like there are some tourist attractions.
The missions tend to be pretty, some people even have their weddings there because they see it as these romantic locations.
But when you consider what happened inside the missions, the pictures are looking a lot like this.
It's kind of like having your wedding at Auschwitz, except that the Nazis had ugly architecture whereas the missions are pretty.
So let's look at why, what was so ugly about the California missions?
Well, for one, start with the fact that the entire mission system was run on slavery.
You, the Spaniards who arrived, set up trade with the natives, capture them, and slave them, force them to build the missions
and then leave off their labor to run the missions.
So the whole thing was driven on enslaving Indians.
Add to these that you can't have slavery without violence, of course.
So there was a lot of violence that characterized the experiences of native people in the missions.
Violence that came into form in the forms of soldiers abusing them just because they could.
And also the priests who sometimes they felt bad about the soldiers abusing the natives but they needed the soldiers' protection however they added their own layer of violence.
Because you know, when you think about the priests like people like Huny Perosera for example, the father figure of the mission system,
this was a guy who regularly whipped himself as part of spiritual discipline and subdued flesh and temptation and all of it.
So he saw no problems whipping native people to teach them better.
So you know, if you are a native, you are getting bit up by the soldiers because they are mean and then you get whipped by the priests because they love you.
It's kind of hard to appreciate the difference there.
So in any case, lots of violence.
And of course the missions were basically death camps since packing in close quarters, Europeans and natives.
Make the natives work like dogs so they are already stretched to the limit physically.
And then what happens anytime you put Europeans and natives together, diseases spread, they start wiping out the native population,
the reality is that native people are dying like flies in the missions.
And the only way to keep them going was to go enslave more of them, bring them in.
They were a few attempts at rebellions in the missions.
But for the most part, most Californian natives were not the strongest when it came to military action.
So their best bet was to try to run away and stay far away.
But so sorry that typically you are very cute romanticized story of the missions.
If you go visit most of the missions, you get this disnified version.
I hate to tell you that that's just not the case.
The real history of the missions is really dark when you consider the native role in there.
Okay, so now that I've ruined your day, I think my mission has been accomplished.
No, sorry about it. I mean, see you later.
Wish I could tell you some happy Disney story, but that's just not the way it worked out here.
So in light of that, I will now shut up and we'll continue on with the next one.
