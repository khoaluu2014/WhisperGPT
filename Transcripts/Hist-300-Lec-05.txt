Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to lecture number five.
Right now we're looking at the 1700s and I'll start with a smaller story and then we're going to a really big one, the main thing that we're gonna cover today.
The small one is a war that takes place in 1715, beating a couple of tribes and again for the exact spelling you may wanna look at the PowerPoint.
But specifically the Yama Se and the Creek.
This guy, sometimes this is referred to as the Yama Se War because what happened here is a bit of a different story compared to what normally happens as part of the Fortrade.
These took place in the Carolina which is very far away from the centers of the Fortrade around the Great Lakes area.
And unlike what happened in the rest of the Fortrade where the French were a major player, there weren't hardly any French traders in the Carolinas.
This was pretty much only English traders.
And the practice of the Carolina traders really got on the nerves of the tribes because often they would, the Carolina traders would begin by offering goods on credit.
And then they would doctor the books to make sure that the interest would keep piling and no matter how much native hunters would go out and get, they always owe them more.
And then when they couldn't pay up their debts they would demand land or they even would enslave people and take them away to sell them into slavery and make money that way.
Needless to say, these practices didn't fly very well with the Yama Se with the Creek and a few other tribes.
So annoyed with these, some people from these tribes decided to join together and kill several traders.
Once they started they decided let's just clean out the Carolinas from English influence, let's just kick them all out.
So many Creek and Yama Se joined together.
And now both sides, both the English on one side and the Creek and the Yama Se on the other,
went to one of the biggest tribes in the era, the Cheroquis, to try to convince them to join their side.
Now keep in mind when we say things like the Cheroquis were implying that there was one single political voice that spoke for them.
That was not the case.
There were many different Cheroquis villages, we even thought they all spoke the same language, shared the same culture.
They were not one political unit.
So what happened is that the Yama Se and the Creek approached some Cheroquis village saying, look,
today they attack us but tomorrow maybe you're led just unite, let's build this Pan-Indian alliance and fight against the English.
The English traders on the other hand would go to the same Cheroquis village saying,
oh those guys, we have a problem with those guys because they are terrible and they don't pay their debts.
But we don't have a problem with you, we actually cherish your friendship and to show you how much we cherish your friendship,
we're actually going to give you a bunch of free gifts.
So both sides are trying to convince the Cheroquis to join them and in many ways what they will decide will
have a big impact on the outcome of the war.
What happens is that a small minority of Cheroquis joined the Yama Se and Creek,
a larger percentage decide to join the English and an even larger percentage yet decide to stay neutral.
So the outcome of these will be that eventually after some fight in the English are able to overcome this Yama Se and Creek alliance,
beat them and push them off and the Yama Se and the Creek will flee into Florida
where they will eventually help give rise to the Seminole.
That was the small story I wanted to tell you.
Now on to the big one.
The big one is really the story of the 1700s in North America.
As far as native tribes are concerned, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of clashes between the French and their native allies on one side versus the English and their native allies on the other.
One more thing I want to mention before we get into this.
Something that I may have remarked before that I think I need to emphasize for during case I didn't make the point clear enough earlier on,
following the Pueblo Revolt at the end of the 1600s in 1680 to be precise.
Thousands and thousands of Spanish horses fell into native hands and they were traded from tribe to tribe.
Allowing people from many tribes to completely transform their culture in the 1700s.
So you may have seen from movies, from reading books, from everything, the classic image that you see of Native Americans in the historical record, at least in movies and other things like that.
You see native peoples hunting by zone on horseback, leaving in teepees and all of that.
We are so accustomed to that image that we kind of consider the typical native lifestyle.
Now that wasn't typical at all.
That was a result of colonization as well.
Because what happens is that you have
horses which were not domesticated prior to contact with Europeans
now being incorporated into the lifestyle and in many ways that life of some of the tribes will never be the same as they adapt to the horse
they become full-time buffalo hunters.
They are able to cover distances they would have never covered before and they will essentially end up having the best of both worlds between
hunting and gathering but on a much larger scale thanks to the horse.
And the other aspect of why it's a result of European colonization is that some of the tribes used to leave for the least and they get kicked onto the great plains at the time
when horses become available.
So the combinations of these factors lead to
the creation of this new lifestyle and that's going to be a huge part of native lives on the great plains in the 1700s.
But as I was saying earlier in the 1700s if you go a little bit earlier,
well actually not necessarily earlier but if you go a little bit further east and you look at
what was going on around the Great Lakes are and all the place where the interaction between Europeans and natives have been the strongest so far.
A lot of the 1700s are dominated by the clash between English and their native allies and French and their native allies.
You see traces of these happening before like the main war pitting the British and the French against one another is known
either as the Seven Years War if you are looking at this conflict on a global scale or the French and Indian War if you look at it in a purely North American level.
But before even this happened there were
native people play a huge role in the lead up to this conflict.
For example, back in the late 1740s
there was a chief of the Miami tribe sometime nicknamed Old Breton who
decided to switch alliances and abandon the French and instead began trading with the English.
This was a big departure because most of the tribes in the area were French allies.
By the way you are missing the Miami tribe you know normally we think Miami, Florida.
I have no idea I end up with this geographically displaced name but in any case the Miami tribe was a tribe from the Great Lakes area not from
you know maybe Oldo western Ohio some places like that but definitely not
Florida in any case.
So this one guy decide he's going to switch alliances and he builds this big village
where he
begin to draw in the support for all the people who wanted to abandon the French alliance.
Other tribes where allied with the French are a bit upset about this because they are
now they're going to have competition from other native tribes for the same kind of trade.
So tribes like the Ottowa and the Ojibwa are really annoyed with this guy. They try really hard to convince him to return to a
alliance with the French.
This Miami chief just dismissed them and kind of responded rather rudely to them.
So the Ottowa and the Ojibwa don't take it well. They attack this village.
They are not really out to kill everybody or anything they actually inflate very few casualties.
Mainly they were after him so they captured the Miami chief they kill him and to drive
home a point to everyone else who was having ideas of breaking with the French alliance and
they decide to eat him in front of everybody. Now cannibalism usually
tends to make a statement so it's one of the things that scare other people into who
maybe I should keep this visual image of the guy boiling in a pot
in mind before I the next time I think to switch to the English.
So what end up happening is that each
this is what makes this period of history interesting is that you don't just have the French and the British
and the natives are just pawns in their hands.
You have each tribe making very careful calculations to see what was in their best interest.
Competing with one another, being ready to join with one European group or switch alliance as go to another
this is not a story of English and French fighting each other. This is a story where
a bunch of tribes along with the French and the English play a role and they are all trying to
jock in for power in this very unstable political environment.
So in any case what happens and I'm gonna go in more details about the beginning of the French and
Indian war and then we'll start skimming through a little but what we see happening is that
both the French and the English and again even that I need to be a little more precise because
when I say the English the reality is that there were several different English colonies there
were not really very unified. So for example for Gina and Pennsylvania didn't always like
each other that much and they were both trying to get some land so it's not just the English,
specific colonies here we have the French alongside and the colony of Virginia in particular looking
to expand into an area that they all wanted the forks of the Ohio River because whoever
controlled the Ohio River will control much of the trading desire so both of them were very
interested in being able to establish a fort there.
The Virginians had sent some men to start building a fort.
Within a few days the French are with their soldiers showed up.
Said thank you very much for start building our forts but we'll take over from here because
this is our land we claim it first. The Virginians had said that they are claiming it first so both
sides are claiming it. Now keep in mind European powers did not recognize Indian title to the land.
They only recognize the title of other European powers and so whoever got to plan the flag first
got to claim it and their both of them say they have done it first.
So what happens is the in 1754 a young George Washington
he's only like 21 22 something like that he gets to be sent by the governor of Virginia to negotiate
with the French to say hey this is not we claim this land first the French are very polite with
him but essentially they say yeah right get out of here and they build the fort there are the forks
of the Ohio by the way the place where the forks of the Ohio are today is the modern city of bit
of Pittsburgh they grew out of this initial settlement with a French fort first and we'll see
what happens later. So Washington got to be sent north again this time with some 200 men and a
few native allies Samirocoy who had decided to join the English they go to the area with the
with the purpose of trying to if necessary use force to try to convince the French to leave the
area there in the woods they run into a French force and Washington orders his troops to open fire
so they kill a few men they capture a bunch of others and you know the French are saying why
did you shoot at us we were coming in a diplomatic mission to talk to the governor of Virginia why
did you shoot at us Washington is beginning to think hopes maybe I did I handle the situation in the
best possible way but there's still a way to fix it this is after all a very small engagement it
doesn't have to get much worse than that except that one of the Iroquois chiefs was there with
Washington he had staked this reputation on going with the English and they are really gone hard
against the French so if they make peace and this would allow some of the Iroquois to return to a
French alliance this would not go well for him so to make sure that peace will be impossible the
guy who woke up to this wounded French officer and drove at Omaha in his skull and at that point
Washington has clearly lost control of the situation and is now in deep waters because it's not going
to be easy to try to make peace with the French after you just murdered one of their officers
was your prisoner and Washington realized things are getting bad ears so he decided to split
especially when he realized that one of the French soldiers had managed to escape and that's gone to
the French fort nearby to warn them so you see how there's a native role that's rather important in
fielding this conflict further as Washington and this guy's began to retreat he was overrun by the
French and their native allies Washington himself was captured and was only released after he signed
a confession taking the blame for having captured actually for having killed a captured French officer
this was a public relations disaster for Britain
now of course Washington will later say well you know I didn't really mean it
he had to sign this document that was poor candlelight I couldn't fully read it I don't speak a good
French you know he'll take back his ward essentially but the damage is done this is the letter that
now the French can use to make a case to start a war so shortly thereafter as it's becoming clear
that war is brewing between the French and the English both sides are going to try to recruit
as many native allies to them as possible based on their previous relations and you know I mentioned
to you that generally the French had much friendlier relations with the tribes they were able to get
a lot of tribes on their side whereas only a small minority joined the English and usually only if
they were rival with tribes who joined the French majority of tribes in North America clearly were
not involved in this conflict since he was mostly fought along the Great Lakes and only in parts of
the East but for the tribes that were involved this was a very big deal so what happens is in 1755
the English send their first army and their this general Edward Bradock to try to crush the French
in this particular expedition there were many people who play a major role in the American
Revolution from Washington himself Thomas Gage Daniel Morgan Daniel Boone not that you guys need
to remember this but just telling you for your information so Braddo can this rather large army
day slowly head north going toward this this French fort and the forks of the Ohio
in the days of the march natives are a ghostly presence that makes that sand
create a lot of fear among Bradock soldiers you know every time British soldiers trace a little
away go off in the woods on their own they are found murdered and their bodies just left
behind for the army to find or you know some of the natives will scratch into the bark of the trees
little drawings showing that they are watching the English army showing that they mean to attack
them soon so many of the English soldiers are really nervous they are you know they're first
they first arrived from England they've never been near they've heard all these tales about
native Americans they are a little bit concerned here so what happens is eventually a group of
native mainly native allies with some French soldiers will ambush this English army in the
middle of the forest and just wipe them out they they're able to kind of snipe at them from behind
the trees whereas English war tactics hadn't really adapted to fighting in the forest they
were still fighting in a more formal manner that may have worked in Europe really didn't work in
the forest of North America the army's crash Bradock himself is killed Washington kind of leads
the survivors into a quick retreat and technically speaking the French and the natives could kill
Washington and the other guys as well and the only reason why they don't
which is kind of funny when you consider how big of a role Washington will play in the American
Revolution the only reason why they don't is because after a tough battle they get on to the
battlefield and they feel like okay we could chase those guys and kill a few more or you know they
take a look around they see that the British army left a lot of supplies and goodies and run behind
or we could just sit here and have a big party and so many of them to say uh forget it forget
chasing those guys so it's kind of crazy to think that Washington survived only because the French
and natives decide to have a big party on the battlefield rather than chase them by in any case
this was the worst defeat of British forces in North America so far and what's gonna happen after
this point is that the native tribes will begin raiding the frontier up and down attacking
cabins attacking settlers and all of these and the reason being is because to them these were not
civilians these were not people who they just happened these were the enemy much more than the
king of England was very removed from the action it was these families were squatting on what used
to be in the homeland just a few years before were where the number one people the natives
identified as having stolen their land and so they were the first one that they were more than happy
to kill these terrors spreading along the frontier because of all the native raids against the cabins
out there in many ways well there are a couple of things i want to tell you about it one is that
in addition to killing a bunch of people they also captured a bunch of people and this is a
curious cultural thing that was going on among tribes in this area what they would do is that
they would look to replenish their numbers from people killed in warfare or diseases or anything
like that by capturing people from outside of the tribe and if they decide they like them they would
want to adopt these people to replace their family members so you could have some
English people or Swedes or wherever some of these people were from being captured and if the
natives liked them they would adopt them and these people become a new son for a native family or a
sister or a brother or so it's very interesting that somebody could be reshaped into taking somebody
else's identity not even of the same ethnic group and then if they did adopt you then they
would love you and treat you like a real family member so much so that many of the people were
kidnapped and were adopted into native tribes would then never want to leave their adopted family
even though they were kidnapped usually in very violent circumstances they became so immersed in
their new role that when given the option to escape very few took it and many of them would
want to stay with their native families for the rest of their lives so that's a really interesting
one right there and what makes it even we're there so is that on one end you hear the story
and it's like oh that's almost sweet they kidnap people and adopt them and then they love them
they become their family yeah that was half of the story that is if they like you and they think
you can be adopted if they didn't like you then you would be rich while he tortured and killed
over a period of multiple days sometime and said these were the same people you know the same people
who could be the sweetest human beings who adopt you treat you well will give everything they have
for you will be the same people who would be roasting you on a fire if they decide they don't like you
talk about you know when we want our stories to be simple good guys but guys yeah this is now one of them
the other thing i want to tell about indian raids on the frontier is this is that to a large degree
these raids provided the seeds for the creation of an american identity now what do i mean by that
the people in the english colon is a nothing in common with one another they spoke of different
languages because you had the people who spoke gaielik people who spoke english people who spoke
german's people who spoke other northern european languages so technically they saw themselves as
different language wise they spoke different languages religion wise they belong to often to
different denominations the richer people and the poorer people saw each other in very negative
terms they are nothing in common and they often hated each other except that now they all equally
feared native raids on the frontier so as weird as it's sound to say it hating indians will be
the first thing that they all have in common and will be the first thing that begin to shape
an american identity something that will be they'll unify the people through all the british colonies
you know nothing like having a common enemy and in this case hating american indians will be the
glue that bring them together in any case i'm not going to take you through a blow by blow account
of the french and indian war by the way if you want to be technical the french and indian war goes
from 1754 to 1760 whereas the seven years war goes from 1756 to 1763 the french and indian war is a
subset of the seven year war the seven year war is the name that's used for the clash that happens
between friends and d england not just in north america but everywhere the french and d england
colonies so they'll fight in europe they'll fight in the america they'll fight in the middle east
they fight in asia this is literally you can probably consider this the first war the war
because it happens in on a very large scale and it involves a bunch of different peoples but
as far as the north american theater is concerned it's primarily it begins a little early and it will
be the spark for this global conflict as well as it uh ends a little earlier in any case point being
the um despite the fact that the french and their native allies do very well for quite a while
eventually the english will be able to win this war conquer kanada and essentially kick out the
french from north america i mean not the french people there were still french people in north
america but the french as a colonial power is gone they're out after this you know so far
natives have been able to play french and d england against each other and switch alliances and do
this to their benefit from this point forward england will remain as the number one european
power north america which will be will dramatically reduce the power of native tribes as a result of
it because they will have less agency now that they're dealing with this one monolithic european
power so that's a huge legacy of the of the war now one thing that's pretty crazy about it
is that even though native people have been fighting on both sides of this war when the war ends in 1763
the need there no native people would be included at the peace negotiations you know the peace treaty
will be done between french and d england as if no one else had played a role in it and this turned
out to be a really stupid idea because what happens is that native tribes did not you know the english
will see the tribes as oh you are allied with the french so you lost the war and now that the french
sign a peace treaty obviously you must have agreed by default as well the native see in a very
different light they see it as he defeated the french you didn't defeat us so we have nothing to do
with that peace treaty we're not covered by it you're not giving us any guarantees you're actually
wanting more of our land so yeah this is not going to work out that way so almost as soon as the ink
was dry on the peace treaty for the end of the seven years war another conflict springs out in
north america sometime referred to as Pontiac War after the name of one of the main native military
leaders will play a role in this story Pontiac was a warrior leader of the ottawa tribe
another important figure in the building up to Pontiac War was a guy by the name of neolene
also known as the dellaware prophet was as the name implies religious leaders for the dellaware
tribe and essentially what happens is a bunch of the tribes that used to be allies of the french
the ottawa de dellaware de ojibua de potawatomi de shoni and a bunch of others joined together
into the side into fight the english because they did not consider themselves defeated and
they were ready to fight for their lands they were upset that the british were no longer giving
gifts the way the french did to cultivate diplomacy they were upset that the british were clearly
land the hungry and wanted to expand west so they begin this war by attacking several english
forts and burning quite a few of them through ground this is a war that's very brutal and very
effective you know both sides will do horrible things to one another it's in the context of this
war that there's um there's a story well if the evidence is messier but there's a possibility
that the english may have been using biological warfare against the natives here because there's
at least a letter by an english commander saying that they were planning to hand out blankets
to the natives have gifts during the truce but these blankets would be taken from smallpox
victims so in order to infect the natives some people argue that this did happen other people
said it was just a plan but it was not carried out we're not entirely sure uh because of course
whereas early on diseases were always spread unintentionally because no one knew out diseases
were passed along in the 14 or 15 hundreds by now they've figured it out so there was this plan
to use biological warfare native people do did some pretty weird things as well there's
one instance for example in which during a tense truce a group of fojibwa decided to stage a lacrosse
game outside of an english fort and at one point they make it look like the bold by chance just
an app going inside the fort so all the players ran inside but right there the women standing by
the entrance of the forts they opened you know they lift their blankets they hand out a bunch
of weapons to the players the players come into the fort and kill a whole bunch of people
you know both sides they were playing tough both sides understood that this was a war to the finish
to some degree however leader side can successfully defeat the other because the tribes are way you
know the British have spent so much money during the seven years war that they are broke the last
thing they can afford is to finance another long war they are hoping to defeat the tribes
quickly they realize they can't so they can't really carry on the war very well the natives on
the other hand they were doing extremely well to the point that the British couldn't defeat them
but they could not at the same time defeat the British in convincing fashion fully kick them
out so it really is kind of a draw and so the British want a piece and part of what they will do to
entice natives to go toward peace is issuing something known as the royal proclamation of 1763
and the royal proclamation is basically a document they will state that the British will no longer
expand the west that all the land that they have east of the Appalachian Mountains will be their land
which is basically what they have already conquered but the land west of the Appalachian Mountains will
remain native land and they will not go there eventually these Alps bring in this conflict to an end
but not everybody's happy about it particularly many English settlers were extremely upset with
this because they were hoping to push west taking the land and make some money that way
so the fact that their own government is saying no more we are stopping this does not please them
there's a letter written by George Washington to one of his friends in which he addressed the
issue of the proclamation in pretty blunt terms he says I can and this quote by the way is up on
the PowerPoint but it's a I can never look upon the proclamation in any other light
than as a temporary expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians
and one that must fall of course in a few years any person therefore who neglects the present
opportunity of hunting out good lands and in some measure marking and distinguished them for their own
in order to keep others from settling them will never regain it
so what what Washington is saying here is look we understand that this proclamation will be broken
this is something that we do now to calm those guys down but eventually will be broken so he's
advising his friend to actually push west illegally put some flag up to claim the land first so that
he can have some choice land when the frontier will move west so that tells you a lot about these
legal agreements entered by the English with the natives the fact that most of the people on the
English side believe that these agreements were just temporary they wouldn't really meant to last
even though they were written as something that was meant to last turns out also that Washington
advice is not very good idea for his friend who will be captured by Delaware Indians and torture to
death but in any case you can kind of understand why the the conflict between the natives and the
English was not was not really fully resolved here you know if there are if people were treating
the royal proclamation in this light you can imagine that conflict was brewing
and that's definitely and in some way not just conflict between the natives and the English
even conflict between English settlers and their own government here you've seen in some way the
seeds of the American Revolution which are directly tied to the end of the French and Indian War
are directly tied to things like the royal proclamation are directly tied to the heavy debt
that the British had accumulated during the war these are all things that will contribute to the
beginning of the American Revolution but I will keep that discussion and the discussion regarding
the native impact of the revolution for next time so for today we are done you have a very good day
