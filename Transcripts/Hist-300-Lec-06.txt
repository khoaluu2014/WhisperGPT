Hello and welcome to lecture number six. So today we'll start up with the impact of the American Revolution on Native Life.
And again one thing you may have noticed in these lectures I'm really trying to boil down the information to the minimum possible effective stuff to convey very much the big picture because of course a theme like this you know the effect of the revolution on Native Life.
People could write 500 page dissertations on this stuff and we're all going to do it in a few minutes so obviously we're not going to the same degree of depth.
But I just want to give you at least a general in you know it seems more appropriate for an introductory course to present to cast the net wide and paint a more general picture rather than getting all the details.
Of course if you are interested in more details I can always try to direct you to other possible references for you to check out.
In any case the American Revolution goes from 70-75 to 1783.
And the way is going to play out there are going to be a couple of major reasons. I mean the main reason that usually for the American Revolution revolves around taxation.
The fact that the British were heavily taxing their colonies in North America even though the settlers here did not have any kind of representation in the English government.
So the whole idea of taxation without representation is a big one.
And it's true I mean the taxation issue was a direct result of the Seven Years War.
The fact that the English had gone pretty much bankrupt by spending so much to fight France in the Seven Years War meant that now they needed to pick up money for the war.
They needed to pick up money from somewhere and they raised tax in England and their people were really mad and then they raised them out here and people are mad.
But you know they need to raise taxes somewhere and understandably though you know they both make sense.
The English need to have the money to run government and the Americans don't want to be paying for it if they don't have representation.
So there are also other sites.
Last time we finished off the lecture talking about the impact of things like the royal proclamation.
The fact that the English government that made a peace with native tribes say they no longer expand west.
This is something that anger a lot of settlers in the English colonies who wanted to expand west.
So it was yet another reason to resent the English government.
So in light of this, when conflict between settlers and the British crown erupted in open, you know it stopped being a theoretical conflict and erupted in open war,
native people find themselves matching the same position as they had done during the Seven Years War,
of being asked to choose to join either one side or the other.
Now clearly, natives were no friends of the English, consider they just fought a bunch of wars with them.
But at the same time what the Americans were proposing was even worse.
Because the English at least had dancing like signing their art proclamation, you know they were probably going to try to steal your land but they were going to be slow about it.
The Americans very clearly were after land and quickly.
And so between somebody who wants to steal your land now and somebody who will be lazy about stealing your land,
you probably pick the lazy one because it gives you a little bit of more guaranteeing that you'll get to keep your lands longer.
So a bunch of tribes end up reluctantly join the English.
Some tribes will join the American side and many tribes will stay neutral.
Now obviously the ones who join the English does not mean that they were opposed to the ideals of the declaration of independence.
You know when you read the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, it's actually this pretty beautiful document that states these fellows off,
like for example the quote classic quotes, we hold this truth to be self-evident.
That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Well native peoples are nothing against this idea.
The problem is that in order for them to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, they had to join against the Americans.
Because the Americans were the most likely among the two continents to deny them the rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, to try to take their land.
There's actually a paragraph later in the Declaration of Independence that mentions American Indians directly.
You know after the beginning of the declaration, which is more this beautiful philosophical statement, the rest of the whole thing turns into this lonely list of grievances against the King of England.
And one of them involves native people. Here it says, he, meaning the King of England, has excited domestic insurrections among us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages,
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
Now this tells you some stuff.
I mean start with the language, the feather in the glaresh of independence, there is this obviously racist language, you know, the merciless Indian savages.
Yeah that gives you a feeling for the time.
But also it's funny because here he's accusing the King of England of having encouraged American Indians to attack poor innocent American colonists,
which makes zero sense because why in the world would the King of England encourage native tribes to fight against the people paying his taxes.
What this is referring is a couple of things. One is referring to the alliance with native tribes that the English were making at the beginning of the revolution,
but the other aspects also refer to probably to the royal proclamation. At a time when many Americans would illegally cross the border into native land,
and they would want the English army to protect them from Indian resistance.
And when they didn't, then that gets returned into, he got the Indians to attack us.
Well, not really. It's a bit more complicated than that.
In any case, despite the rhetoric of the revolution about the natural rights of man, freedom from tyranny and all of that stuff,
the reality was that for native people joining the English was the only choice that gave them at least some vague hope of being able to keep their lands.
So that's why they did it.
Not that their choices were very good, because the reality is that, I mean, eventually, the Americans will be able to pull off the upset and defeat the British.
So clearly the tribes who joined the British will be out of luck because the Americans will be after them to take their land.
Same thing with the tribes who stayed neutral, Americans will be out there to take their land.
And paradoxical, even those who had joined the Americans were being fighting in the revolution.
They will go back home only to find that in the meantime, squatters were not fought in the war and stolen their lands.
So the revolution is a disaster for native people, any which they use lies.
It's bad. It's bad if you join the English, it's bad if you stay neutral and it's bad if you join the Americans.
There's no getting out of this.
And of course, at the Treaty of Paris in 1783, again, just like the last time, despite the fact that British, the native people have been fighting on both the British and the American side, no native peoples will be included at the peace negotiations.
So for native people, American success and the creation of the United States is a tragedy.
Because it means that there's a nation of land hungry colonists without any restraints now who are out to push West.
So the English restraint, however weak it had been, is no longer there.
Now, of course, the idea that you want to expand the West and the idea that you have actually the capacity to expand the West, those are two very different things.
And the American government will find out about it rather quickly.
Even though the sentence manifest destiny was not used at this time, it won't be used until really the 1840s during the context of the Mexican American war.
But the context, you know, the meaning of manifest destiny even told the precise words were not used was very much alive at this time in American history.
What we have here is what exactly is the idea of manifest destiny?
Well, that means the notion of a God-given right of superior civilizations to be taken over the lens of so-called inferior civilizations.
And how do you define superior and inferior, you know, being white and Christian was superior and being non-Christian and non-white meant inferior?
There's in the PowerPoint that I posted on Beachboard.
You have there's a painting from the 18 Andrze.
It's the very much captured spirit.
You know, you see this angel flying up high and this kind of leading civilization westward.
On the right side of the painting, you see all the symbols of American civilization.
You see the railroad, you see the telegraph lines, you see agriculture.
And at the forefront, you see tough guys with guns pushing American Indians and wild animals away.
And you see a bunch of wild animals running away.
You see American Indians running away and even the color scheme of this painting, you know, whereas on the one side is very light and bright and all of it, the other side is darkness.
It's almost this notion that this is symbolizing not just the expansion of the United States, but the expansion of Christianity against the forces of evil.
And that's basically how they viewed it back then.
You know, Manifah's destiny was very much rooted in this notion of Christian right, of these religious, you know, that God wants you to take over the land of non-Christians.
So, I mean, it's a concept that is obviously very racist and weird on multiple levels.
You know, today, if you argue for Manifah's destiny is a bit unless you go with the KKK, that's a little weird.
But then however it wasn't, you know, actually, if you didn't argue for Manifah's destiny, you would have been a weirdo.
It's like, what do you mean you don't want to cover in the online?
You know, you want the servants of the devil to win?
Is that what you're saying?
Is like that would have been the feeling back then.
But in any case, as I mentioned a minute ago, wanting to expand the West and having the ability to expand the West, those are two very different things.
And there's a bit of a clash between two goals of the revolution.
You know, one end Americans wanted to expand the West.
On the other end, they also don't want to pay taxes.
Which is a bit of a problem because what do you need in order to expand the West?
Stop assuming you need a powerful army.
And how do you build a powerful army with taxes?
So initially, the American government tried to send these kind of underfunded armies hoping that they would take care of business, defeat tribes and pave the way West.
So here you have in 1790, for example, a group of tribes such as the Miami, the Shoney and a few others going into battle against American forces.
In what will be one of the worst defeats suffered by the US army at the hands of Native Americans until that point?
They will get miserably crushed.
Some people will blame it on the fact that the general leading the army had been royally drunk during this campaign.
So they decide, okay, let's try again next year with a general who hopefully is not royally drunk.
We'll make it a little...
Now will be effective. So in 1791, they send this new general, Arthur Sinclair,
against this coalition of Shoney, Potawatomi, Miami, Delaware and a few others.
And again, they get crushed, even worse than the year before.
Hundreds of US troops are killed, this is just bad.
So for the first few years, the desire of American expansion doesn't turn into reality.
But eventually by 1794, the American army does manage to start defeating the tribes and does manage to push west,
break this confederacy of tribes and start taking over land.
So that's the context that we're looking at here.
One of the... I mentioned one tribe, Amino Tago.
I mentioned the Shoney.
The Shoney are interesting because, well, all tribes were faced with a choice.
You had to figure out whether to assimilate if it even died was an option or to resist or what to do.
For example, among the Iroquois, there was a Iroquois leader by the name of Handsome Lake.
In 1799, he claimed he had this vision and he started preaching this new way, where the Iroquois would adopt a lot of American beliefs.
They would adopt elements of Christianity.
They would be okay with Western style education.
They would emphasize primarily farming.
They would try to dismantle some of their maternal-linear clans.
But at the same time, they would want to hold on to some of their lands and keep some of their traditions.
Handsome Lake was more like a male-law reformer trying to find a way to change Iroquois culture in such a way as they would be able to keep some land within the United States.
Other guys, in very similar circumstances, however, they chose a very different position.
So, for example, among the Shownis that I mentioned Amino Tago.
In 1805, a guy by the name of Tense Quattawa also claimed to have a vision.
Tense Quattawa used to be an alcoholic.
One day, he passed out, he has this vision.
He gives up alcohol and changes everything in his life.
Tense Quattawa said that God had appeared to him and he was told that to give up everything European, that natives have become weak ever since they say that they have been able to do it.
They started depending on European things, so they should give up alcohol, no longer have intermarriages.
If anybody adopted Christianity, give that up, refuse any of the cultural characteristics they had adopted from white people.
And instead, join forces with other native tribes.
This is the key message of Tense Quattawa's vision.
It's inter-tribal.
This is not just for the Shownis.
This is for all native tribes together.
There's a funny story that the governor of Indiana, upon hearing from some native people about Tense Quattawa preaching this message, which clearly was a message that most Americans were not happy about, because obviously if he's successful, he could unite a bunch of tribes in resisting American expansion.
So the governor said, this guy claims to be a prophet.
Come on, give me a break.
This guy is a phony.
If he's already a prophet, he should ask him to perform some kind of miracle.
And so some of these natives go to Tense Quattawa and say, hey, are you the real deal?
Do you have powers?
Tense Quattawa says, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry.
Just show up, tell your friends to come on such and such a day, and on that day I will stop the sun.
You know, it's pretty convincing.
So the world starts spreading.
And on such and such a day he would perform this miracle.
And on that appointed date, Tense Quattawa gets out of his lodge, praise, that there's an eclipse of the sun.
Everybody goes, whoa.
When he said, don't worry, the sun will come back now, but now we have seen my power.
Now, how did that happen?
Some people in certain tribes had amazing astronomical knowledge, so it's possible he may have been able to predict it.
Or he heard different somebody or who knows, for all I know, he stopped the sun, what do I know?
In any case, far from a reducing Tense Quattawa's power, this actually increased this prestige.
His brother, a guy by the name of Tecansa, wasn't really sold on his own brother's religious message.
He probably knew him too well to buy fully into it.
But it's very much like the political implication of this appeal to create a Pan-Indian alliance, and by Pan-Indian Amina,
an alliance based on a common sense of Indian identity, as opposed to being based on just tribal identity.
So Tecansa was entirely sad to travel from Florida to Canada, convincing as many tribes as possible to join with him.
And he was fairly successful, you know, many tribes joined, some didn't, because they were still stuck in the more old-time intertribal rivalries kind of mindset.
But many did.
By 1811, the Americans decided these guys are getting too powerful, we should nip this in the bad, so they attack Tense Quattawa's village,
where he was known as Prophetstown.
Now the battle is nothing to write him about, he's very minimal casualties on both sides.
But the Fedatense Quattawa was not able to use his powers to stop the Americans, kind of led to a loss of prestige for him.
So instead, his role will sort of be eclipsed by Tecansa, who since did not rely on some religious claim, his political role was unchanged.
And he was really the main leader of this movement.
Tense Quattawa's movement and the challenge that he posed to American expansion is merged with a major war that the US got into, the War of 1812, which is the last one that the United States will fight against the British.
Couple of reasons for the War of 1812.
One, the fact that the British were regularly stopping American ships on the ocean to check for British desorters who have quit the Royal Navy and maybe found jobs among Americans.
And the Americans are like, hey, you have no jurisdiction, you can stop our ships.
And the other thing was the English support for Tecansa and his allies.
Because their English were supplying him with weapons, with other goods to have him, kind of as a...
to create a buffer zone between English possessions in Canada and the Americans' possessions for Tarsau.
So if you had strong armed natives to block American expansion, this would be good for Canada.
Americans don't like it, so they decide to get into a war over it.
Tecansa obviously will join the English,
participate in several battles, sometimes defeating the Americans, but in 1813 he's killed in battle.
And with the death of Tecansa, the whole movement that he had been building, breaks apart.
You know, he worked really well for eight years, this Pan Indian alliance was very effective,
but eventually he tends with Tecansa's death.
Also to consider is the fact that during these years American population kept growing, like,
for example, between 1800 and 1820 the American population was almost double.
So the demand of land was ever increasing.
During the course of this war of the War of 1812, some people, for example Andrew Jackson,
who got this fame as being the staff Indian fighters, and this fame will help him gain the presidency a few years later.
So this is an important moment because he signaled his desire to create a common Indian alliance,
but it's one that even to succeed in the short term, it fails in the long term.
And with that, I'm going to wrap this thing up for today, and we'll just start it back up next time.
Have a good one.
