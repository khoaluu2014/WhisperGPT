Welcome to lecture number 7. The first people who are going to look at today are the ones that some time are referred to in US history as the so-called the five civilized tribes. The term civilized by the way is obviously a bit of a racist one in this context because the reason why they were referred to the stripes as the five civilized tribes is because what is that made them civilized because they were the ones who are more willing than any other people.
To adopt your American standards of living in order to be allowed to retain some of the land that they occupied. So civilized means more willing to become like Americans. Which of course is a bit of a curious concept. But in any case this is the debate regarding these tribes which by the way they are listed on your power point they are tribes such as the Seminole, the Cherokee, the Chica so.
The Creek and the Chalkto. Those were the five. Cherokee, Chica so Seminole, Creek and Chalkto.
Let's look a little bit at what the general context of the times was why they were trying to adopt American standards and so on.
Basically in the early 1800s there was a bit of debate in the United States. By the time the US had pushed the frontier all the way to the Mississippi River.
The debate revolved around one issue. What do we do with those native tribes who now occupied these little dots of land within some of the existing states that are part of the United States.
One option that was popular in some circuits was, how about we just kill them. Just kill them all. Let's be down with them.
But of course genocide is an option that many people don't particularly like. So while there was an option on the table it was not necessarily one that the US government was ready to embrace at least not yet.
Another option was the idea of assimilation. The notion was if these guys are willing to copy our lifestyle, if they are willing to adapt to our demands, if they are willing to pick up our religion the way we dress, the houses we live in, they make a living like we do, they change their gender roles accordingly.
In other words they do every conceivable thing except taking the Michael Jackson pill that makes you white overnight to become as white as possible, then we could deal with them.
In other words we don't hate them because of their skin color, we hate them because of their stupid culture.
If they get rid of their stupid culture and they become just like us then we could tolerate them being a darker skinned version of ourselves.
Now this is clearly still racism, but it's not racism based on skin color, this is cultural racism.
And that's kind of where the idea of assimilation came from. If we can just get rid of their culture and if they can adopt ours then maybe they can be allowed to keep their lands.
And you can see why then these tribes in the South East would be willing to adopt some American standards because they saw that as the only chance they would have to be able to keep their lands.
A third option on the table was the idea of removal, meaning we don't want to kill them all because that's a little too bloody, but definitely we don't want to have these guys as our neighbors either.
Aba we push them west, forget assimilation just push them west, somewhere where none of us want to live.
Specifically west was that area that today would be Oklahoma and Kansas.
The idea was well there's plenty of land and none of us were never going to want to live in Oklahoma or Kansas anyway, about we just push the stripes west the way we don't have to deal with them, but we don't have to get our hands to dirty by killing them.
So that was another option on the table and a fourth option was Aba we just don't take their lands.
Aba we just accept that let them be who they are on the remaining lands they have and that's it.
As you may imagine this fourth option was supported by about 12 people in the United States at this time, I mean it really wasn't a realistic one because very few people endorsed it.
So it really was between the other three and the one that early on the government seemed to push for was assimilation.
Many of them seemed to push in that direction and so in light of this bunch of the stripes were willing to do whatever it took to satisfy the government to show them that they could assimilate so that they could keep their land.
To some degree or another all five of the so-called five civilized tribes did this but the Cherokees did this probably more than any other.
They began to become literate both in English and Cherokee even at the rate exceeding that of the United States as a whole.
They wrote their own written constitution that was based on the US constitution to organize their tribal government.
They started their own newspaper called the Cherokee Phoenix written again both in English and in Cherokee.
Many of them started adopting Christianity.
Many of them began, you know I told you that for the most part there wasn't a whole lot of intermarriage between natives and whites in the United States.
Well the case of the Cherokee is a bit of an exception. There will be a lot more intermarriage in desirate than anywhere else.
So much so that a fairly large percent of the Cherokee population will become many of them will have a lot of white American ancestors.
Some of them, the more well of usually the more mixed blood ones, they even try to copy the lifestyle of sautoner aristocracy.
They themselves would buy slaves and essentially try to fit in in the south sort of saying look we can be just as fascist as you guys are just can you please us let us stay now.
And this worked for a little while except that in 1827 gold was discovered on Cherokee lands within the boundaries of the state of Georgia.
And so the state of Georgia started a harassment campaign to convince the tribe to leave give up their land and get going.
These was made worse by the federal government because the federal government did the about phase at this time.
They stopped pushing for assimilation and instead they started becoming friendlier and flanlier to the idea of removal.
Andrew Jackson had become president in 1828 and Andrew Jackson had a theme of not exactly being a friend of native peoples.
Part of the way he built his reputation that led to the presidency was the fact that he had been actively fighting against some of these tribes in previous decades.
And being an Indian fighter is something that would get you a lot of votes on the frontier.
And eventually there's a whole text of a speech that Jackson delivered in Congress in 1830.
I put that in the PowerPoint. There are a few paragraphs from that speech where basically Jackson is saying look yeah it's sad that these guys need to essentially disappear to make room for us.
But and I'm going to actually read you the latter part of that speech.
But through philanthropy reconciled the mind to this.
Okay let me paraphrase because actually it's too long I changed my mind.
But it's essentially saying look this is not a big deal because ultimately it's in the best interest of the human race as a whole for us to prosper and for them to disappear.
Because we're the next step in human evolution. Those guys are a bunch of savages.
No matter how much they try to change they will remain a bunch of savages.
So it's only right that we take over the land.
And so with that Congress passed the in 1830 they passed the Indian Removal Act which basically signaled the switch for the United States from supporting the idea of assimilation to instead supporting a removal.
The harassment campaign by the state of Georgia was proceeding at a fairly fast rate.
They were trying to make life miserable for the Cherokee and some of these other tribes in order to convince them to give up their lands and relocate west.
There was one case involving a Cherokee man by the name of Corn Tassel.
The guy, I mean the whole story is not that glamorous. It's a murder case. It's this one guy kills another Cherokee man.
It's and the way the state of Georgia sees his guilty of murder. He gets a trial and he's gonna get hanged.
The way the Cherokee saw it is no no no no. You guys don't get it.
This is a Cherokee man killing another Cherokee man on Cherokee land.
We have a Jewish dictionary. You don't. We decide what happens.
The state of Georgia said no no no no no. It's you who don't get this story.
Because there is no such thing as Cherokee land. You guys are within the boundaries of the state of Georgia so we decide what happens to him.
Showing that the Cherokee saw learned what it takes to be a good American, they did what a good American would do in this case which is hire a lawyer, start a lawsuit and go to court.
Their case went all the way up to the US Supreme Court and is going to be part of a series of three cases that will become known as the Marshall Trilogy after the name of the Chief Justice at the time, John Marshall.
They are gonna be extremely significant because they are gonna create the foundation for all laws affecting American Indians in the United States.
And in this case, Marshall sided with the Cherokee.
They, he comes up with this interesting legal doctrine that still stands to this day about the status of native tribes and native land in the United States.
He referred to them as domestic dependent nations.
Which is kind of a curious concept because by definition a nation is not domestic and is not dependent.
So if you are domestic and dependent, usually that means you're not a nation, but he is calling them a nation and yet he's also calling them domestic and dependent on the federal government.
What does that really mean? Well, Marshall is basically saying reservation land is not subject to the state.
They have enough sovereignty that they are their own independent entity, at least as far as the state is concerned, but they are not so sovereign that they are independent and they are not.
They are not as far as the federal government is concerned.
So they are almost like a state within the state. The state has no jurisdiction over tribal land, but the federal government does.
So it's kind of a partial victory saying, okay, the state of Georgia is no jurisdiction, but you guys have to obey the laws of the United States.
The state of Georgia doesn't really like that very much, so they decide, well, you know what, you can talk all you want, we don't care, we're gonna hang him anyway.
And they basically just ignore the Supreme Court ruling.
Now, technically, when you have a state that ignores a Supreme Court ruling, that means that your president as head of the federal government is supposed to crack down on it and force them to follow federal law.
But Andrew Jackson was more of a Southern sympathizer than not. He was sympathizer for the idea of state rights, and he was not particularly fond of American Indians.
So he definitely didn't want to start something. And if you notice the dates, this is happening in the early 1830s, it's only 30 years away from the American Civil War, precisely on the issue of state versus federal government.
Jackson didn't want to start something over at Cherokee land, so there's a comment that's been attributed to him.
Maybe correctly, maybe it's legend, who knows, but supposedly he said, Marshall made the ruling, let him enforce it.
Meaning, yeah, sure, that law is going to stay in the law books, but as far as enforcing it, I'm not gonna bother. I'm not gonna send troops into state of Georgia or any of that.
And this thing, I told you that there were three cases. There's another case, where basically the same thing happens.
There's another lawsuit to the Supreme Court again confirms that the Cherokee are not subject to the laws of the state and again the states ignore it.
So this leaves the Cherokee in kind of a weird spot because they are winning in the highest court of the land, and it really doesn't matter because the government doesn't enforce the provisions of their victory in court.
So stuck, realizing that the states could harass them as much as they want, despite the legally they couldn't,
some of the Cherokee got convinced to sign a treaty in 1835.
The Treaty of New Dakota, and again the name is spelled out and all of it in the PowerPoint.
One part of the Cherokee tribe by signing this treaty agreed to relocate to Oklahoma voluntarily.
They would in exchange the government would provide for the trip or give them supplies or kind of pay them off for to do this move.
So some of them pack up their sinks and leave their lands for Oklahoma.
Another half of the Cherokee are really upset about this.
They consider the guys who signed the treaty a bunch of traitors because they feel like they are basically telling them that as long as they harass us they can get us to do what they want.
You guys gave in, that's all messed up.
So another group of Cherokee decide to stay behind and fight out against the removal.
But that's not going to work very well because only three years later in 1838 the federal government will crack down.
They will send troops to forcibly relocate the remaining Cherokees out of Oklahoma.
These will become known as the Trail of Tears.
The name itself tells you this is not exactly a happy event.
The really thousands of Cherokees died during this forced removal since they were not prepared.
They did not have the supplies for this trip.
So this is literally a death march for many of the Cherokees.
The ones that do arrive in Oklahoma are mad as they could be against the other Cherokees who had signed earlier on.
So there's a bit of a Cherokee civil war that begins when as the new arrivals mad from all the death and grief they experienced during the Trail of Tears they place a hit against some of the Cherokee leaders who had signed the treaty.
So they send out some warriors to kill them.
Now eventually the two factions are going to stop shooting at each other but the bad blood is very much there.
In many cases this is a classic thing actually.
It happens in a lot of reservation that there's a political fracture between those who are willing to work with the United States government and those who are not so willing to work with them.
And the two sides usually hate one another.
The government will play one side against another in a classic divide and conquer case.
So that's what ends up happening with the Cherokee.
Now when you consider their choices you can kind of understand both sides.
Because you know you have some Cherokees who think look let's be real it would be nice to be able to hold on to our lands but the US government is too powerful.
If they want to kick us out they will be able to kick us out regardless so let's take the best deal we can while we can.
You know it may not sound like the coolest option ever but this is a very realistic look as they look we don't have good option we just have less evil ones.
That's it. Let's take the best we can.
The other approach is definitely more noble sounding is like we will stay and fight for our rights here.
But in terms of realism of course you know that you're probably fighting and losing fight.
Now the way that makes sense is that this guy is figure okay we're gonna fight a losing fight anyway.
Why? Because you think that now we append their lives and we move to Oklahoma and we do all this stuff.
On what on the promise that they are not gonna bother us there?
Don't you think that down the road they're gonna come steal our land there the same way as they're doing here.
And if ultimately that's what it boils down to might as well hash it out here at least if we're to die with down our own land.
They're either than just get be pushed around and they take one inch at a time of everything we have.
Makes sense as well. You know you can kind of see how there's a very logical position for both sides.
But they are put between a rock and a hard place and as they make their choices even though they both make sense the two sides are really gonna hate each other's guts.
These happens with the Cherokee these happens with most of the other among the so-called the five civilized tribes.
The main and I mean before I get to the exception to this story let's just say that these will be typical of many community many native communities in the east.
Most of them will lose their specific tribal identity the ones who stay behind they will intermarion you know still be part of the gene pool but they will disappear as tribes.
Which is why if you look at a map of the United States you're gonna notice that most of the reservations.
Most of the rec- of sizable reservations are located either in the Midwest or in the West. There's not a whole lot in the east because at this time land was just being taken away left and right.
There are exceptions to that but for the most part.
Speaking of exception the one tribe that will make a different decision in regard to this process of removal is the Seminole tribe.
The Seminole they have an interesting history they were out of Florida and the Seminole are well for one they are a relatively new tribe.
They were born from the mixing of many different survivors for various Floridian tribes.
A little bit of other tribes such as the Cree and sorry the creek I meant with the K at the end of the creek and the Yama Se.
So they are essentially a new inter-tribal community born from a few people who fled from one region fled from another they get together they create this village that will become known as the Seminole.
But the other aspect that from an ethnic standpoint will play a role in the creation of the Seminole will be African Americans.
They will be unlike some Cherokees who they would enslave African Americans just as much as white people in the south.
The Seminole in many cases started adopting African Americans.
If African Americans were able to escape plantations slavery and they made it to Seminole villages they would be adopted into the village and kept there.
And they essentially become full fledged members of the tribe.
So with that in mind they were not exactly very well loved in the south.
They got into an early war with the United States between 1816 and 1818 precisely on the issue that the Seminole were taking in African Americans escaping slavery.
The actual reason why Florida become part of the United States because remember Florida used to be part of Spain is because the US will send troops to invade Florida.
Officially for the reason that the Seminole were giving safe evidence to escape African Americans and Spain wasn't doing enough to crack down on this.
That's how the United States acquired Florida with this mouth.
But the Seminole won't give up.
Even when the United States come in control of Florida and even during the period of removal the Seminole decided to stay behind and fight it out.
The main war that they will be involved in will last between 1835 and 1842.
And this is a miserable war for the United States.
It's calculated that in the wars with the Seminole Americans will lose something in the neighborhood of 1500 men.
Some of them to Seminole arrows, most of them to diseases, to ending up in an alligator belly or many of the other ways in which you can die fighting in the swamps of Florida.
So, in this sense the environment, the swampy environment of Florida will be very helpful to the guerilla warfare tactics that the Seminole engaged in.
So, the second war is not enough to defeat them. They get into a third war in the 1850s.
By 1857 when that particle around the warfare ends,
there are still some Seminole will be captured and relocated to Oklahoma.
There are still a bunch of Seminole who stay behind in Florida and are ready to fight a fourth war.
And by that point, that's almost 30 years after removal.
The US government decided to change approach.
They're like, you know what, if you like your stupid swamp that much, just stay there.
Who cares?
So that's the reason why there still is a Seminole tribe in Florida.
Because they were able to fight it out and hold.
So this is a very rare case in which warfare against the United States actually pays off.
And it helps a tribe retain some of their land.
So that's the story of the Seminole that I wanted to mention.
By this point in history, by the early 1800s, the United States had conquered pretty much every single one.
And there was to conquer up to the Mississippi River.
But they really knew very little about what laid the border west.
So a couple of things happened.
In 1803, the United States government would approach the French to buy newer lanes from them.
Now the French, if you recall from at the end of the French and Indian War, they got kicked out of North America.
Pretty much the only place they still held was New Orleans.
And New Orleans was particularly important because of trade.
It was, you know, at the mouth of the river, it was very whoever controlled New Orleans could control the trade.
The French, at this time, they are busy New Europe fighting expensive wars.
So when the United States come in and make them a deal to buy New Orleans, they are more than happy to sell.
Not only that, they are willing to sell over all of the Louisiana territory.
Keep in mind that the Louisiana territory back then was not just the modern day state of Louisiana, it was really also most of the Midwest.
It is what's funny about this thing.
The French really didn't control most of the Midwest.
It was fully and completely into the hands of American Indian peoples.
But if you recall from a previous lecture,
European powers did not recognize native title to the land, but they did recognize the claims of other European powers.
So the fact that the French had traveled through the Midwest, traded there, created a couple of trading posts,
had given them the right to claim the land for themselves, is until they had zero control on it.
So in a way it's kind of strange because it's kind of like, if you come to me and offer me money to sell you somebody else's car,
it's like, sure, I'll do it.
I don't really have a fully legal title, but if you want to give me money for it, why not?
So the US has no illusion that buying the land from the French will mean that they will show up on to the great planes with this document.
They will show it to tribes that most of whom have never heard of the French.
And these guys will say, oh, of course, it's your land that will come on in.
Essentially, the US will have to get the land twice.
Once buying it from the French so that they have title and no other European powers can claim it.
And the second one is actually deal with its legitimate owners who are the native Americans living throughout the Midwest.
So that took place in 1803.
In 1804 and 1805, the United States will support the Lewis and Clark expedition, which basically was an expedition to find out everything they could about the lands further west.
They wanted to know what the land was like.
They wanted to know if it was good for agriculture or not, how many people could it support.
What are the tribes like? Are they friendly? Are they hostile?
Are there any paths to get us to the Pacific Ocean? All of these different things.
That's what the Lewis and Clark expedition did.
Now, let's get back with the focus more on the native side of this story.
The great planes, which are all that are of the United States, basically everything that's in the middle, just west of Minnesota, all the way, modern states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas,
Nebraska, parts of Colorado, before you hit the Rockies.
All of that stuff is the great planes.
And in this old area, there were two sets of tribes that lived there.
There were farming tribes. People would be making a living as sedentary farmers in the area for many, many centuries.
And these were tribes such as the Mandan, Hidatsa, Rika, Poni, Omaha, the bunch more.
By the way, if you don't catch the spelling of any of these, they are in the powerpoints.
These were the original inhabitants of the planes. They had been there for centuries and time for millennia.
Then there was a second set of tribes that played a role in this area.
And those were tribes like the Lakota, also known as Su, Cheyenne, Arapa, Ocro, Caio, Acomanche, Shoshone, Blackfeet, and a whole bunch of others.
These guys were a more recent arrival on the planes. Many of them, not all of them, but many of them used to live for a tourist.
And as the US conquered and they kick out other tribes, these tribes in turn moved west and pushed them.
There was this domino effect of tribes relocating west in the face of American westward expansion.
Many of these tribes used to be farmers, but then they found themselves pushed at the edge of the great planes
at the time when in the 1700s, horses were becoming widely available.
What had happened was that at the end, there was a major rebellion that we barely touched on, I think, in the early review.
But in 1680, there was a rebellion involving the Pueblos kicking out the Spaniards.
At that time, they got their hands on thousands of Spanish horses and they started trading them far and wide.
So by this point, by the latter part of the 1700s, a lot of tribes on the planes started acquiring horses and they completely transformed their way of life.
They became nomadic Bafalo hunters, living in teepees and following the Bafalo herds.
It's amazing actually how quickly the horse is adopted and how quickly these guys become incredibly proficient in the use of the horse.
But in some way, these are the tribes that are the ones you always see when you watch Hollywood movies about American Indians.
So in a sense, if you want to get technical, these guys wear hunters and gatherers.
But remember, everything we said about hunters and gatherers early on.
Imagine the same dynamics, but think of these guys as hunters and gatherers on steroids.
They do everything the hunters and gatherers do, but on a much more massive scale.
Why? Because they had horses, which allowed them to exploit a lot more resources than nomadic people travelling on foot.
So their bands were often hundreds, sometimes even a thousand or two thousand people could be camping together, much much larger than the typical hunter and gatherers thing.
Now in some way we could think that their life was very rough.
I mean, when you think about teepees, these are essentially glorified tents.
Imagine living in a tent in the middle of a winter in Montana, it's so pretty rough.
But the reality is that these guys work teepees down to a science, where they could use some form of insulation, get a fire going in the center of a teepee,
and with a little smoke hole at the top of the teepee where the poles join together, the smoke would go out and the fire would keep the teepee fairly warm, even in the middle of the coldest winter.
So all in all these guys actually had a pretty good life.
They could take down their teepees in just a few minutes, hitch them to their horses and travel over vast amounts of lands following the buffalo herds.
All in all, a really good life.
When you read the accounts of many of them, they speak of it as the best that anybody could hope for.
Their relationship with the sedentary tribes was a complicated one, because on one end they traded with one another because the buffalo hunting tribes wanted agricultural products, the farming tribes wanted some of the buffalo meat.
But they also fought with one another, because they were essentially vying for the same lands.
And not only did they fight with the sedentary tribes, they also fought among each other.
Some of these tribes really didn't like one another.
For example, the crows and the Lakota, or the crows and the Cheyenne, not big friends.
So war was a big part of life on the great plains at this time.
Their idea of war, though, was a little different from the way we think of it.
Not that it couldn't be bloody, because it could.
But I'll give you an example that maybe clarifies.
There was this tradition among nomadic tribes known as Counting Koo.
Counting Koo basically, if you watch any kind of sport, let's say you watch basketball and you can keep track of a player's statistics via their three-pointers or rebounds or things like that.
Koo were statistics for warriors.
So you would count a Koo if you did, if you led a successful raid in war.
You would count Koo if you were able to steal horses from an enemy camp without being killed.
You would count Koo if you were, this is an interesting one.
You would count Koo if you touched an enemy in battle, but not if you killed him.
Why is that? Because the idea was that this Counting Koo system was designed to encourage bravery among the warriors.
And you know, killing somebody, anybody can be 200 yards away and be a good shot and they can kill an enemy.
But if you were touching an enemy in battle, that means you were within just a couple of feet from danger.
That means you are brave. That means you are tough.
So killing an enemy paradoxically didn't count you any Koo.
And each time you counted Koo you gained the right to wear an eagle feather in your air.
Which is why when you see those guys in the movies with the eagle feather or war bonnet with a ton of them,
that's basically them advertising what badasses they are because each one of those feathers stands for something very brave that they did in war.
So that's part of the culture that characterized the demonic tribes.
And of course the other important part of their life was the hunt. Hunting bison.
It's almost a stereotype, the whole idea that these guys used every single part of the bison,
but it's one of those cases where stereotypes actually fit.
Bisons were used for everything you can possibly imagine.
You know, their homes were made of buffalo hides.
That's what the tip is covers were made of.
Some type of weapons were made with pieces of buffalo body.
They would use things like the bladder of a buffalo with the U.B. used as a water bag.
There's really every conceivable part of the bison was used.
One thing that will happen to both sets of tribes on the Great Plains is that starting in the latter part of the 1700s and even more so in the 1800s,
they will be exposed to more American traders coming in.
And of course that means being exposed to more diseases.
When the diseases start spreading among these tribes, they will have a different impact on them.
The nomadic tribes will be hard hit, but they will not be hard hit half as much as the sedentary tribes, the farming tribes.
Why is that for a couple of simple reasons?
The sedentary tribes, for one their villages were always located close to the rivers, so they were visited more often by traders who knew exactly where the villages were.
They would come in and visit and trade stuff.
You know, visiting the nomadic tribes wasn't always that easy because they could be anywhere on the Great Plains.
So the traders at an easier time visiting sedentary villages than nomadic ones.
And on top of it, when the diseases would break out, some kind of an epidemic would break out among them.
A nomadic tribe, they would break up the camp.
Each family would go off in a different direction.
The idea being whoever was sick would then not be able to infect everyone else, at most they would infect their family.
And whoever was still healthy, maybe a month or two later, they would gather together at the base of a mountain or somewhere where they all knew where to meet.
And by that point, the people who had to die had already died, but they hadn't really infected everybody else.
The sedentary tribes couldn't do that because their villages, they couldn't break up and go elsewhere.
Villages took a lot of time and energy to build being sedentary.
So they would just stay in the village praying that they got knocked down and get sick.
But of course the diseases is a much easier time traveling from household to household in that scenario.
There's even a crazy story involved in, I mean some of these tribes were really wiped out by diseases.
You look at tribes like the Mandan for example.
They used to have probably about 15,000 people around the time when the French first met them.
And by almost exactly 100 years later in the 1830s, they had less than 200 people left.
138 to be precise.
That's insane when you think about it.
It's a near complete wipeout of a whole tribe in 100 years, not even from war or anything else just from the diseases.
One strange episode that involved the Omaha tribe.
The Omaha started seeing that they were getting sick and they had seen their neighbors and their neighbors' neighbors experience these horrific fates.
You know dying of something like smallpox is not a pretty death.
You know smallpox, a ravage your body, really rip you to pieces.
And then after a long time in horrible pain, you die, desagonizing death.
So nobody was looking forward to death.
So the Omaha had decided to go on the suicide migration where they decided, you know, if we're going to die, we might as well go down fighting.
So why don't we leave our villages and let's attack every single one of the tribes that we have read problems with and at least we'll die fighting.
Oddly enough what happens is that once they are on the move, the people who are sick die much faster because they can't keep up with the rhythm.
It's too rough.
And after a few fights, the Omaha turn around, look around and say, hey, turns out all the sick people are already dead.
That means maybe we are not all going to die. Maybe we don't need to go on the suicide migration.
Huh, look at that. So turns out to work well for them.
Having said all these, let me explain to you something about the impact of the Mexican American war in specific and now this will affect America's population.
This will affect American Indian life on the Great Plains.
So forgive me for a few minutes. I may be talking about something that doesn't sound like it has to do with American Indians, but it will have a big impact on American Indian life.
So it's worth understanding it.
Basically what happens is that there were a lot of states that are part of the United States today.
It used to be part of Mexico. Some of the big ones in specific are Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
These lands, the northern territories of Mexico were not that densely populated.
You know, there were Mexican people living here, of course, but comparatively speaking, not that many.

You know, some of the Anglo Americans start coming into Texas.
The Mexican government doesn't seem to mind. You're like, you know, extra people may help us out fighting the tribes for control of these lands.
They may pay some taxes.
This is not a bad deal. They are kind of asking them to say, look, we want you to assimilate to Mexican society, so learn how to speak Spanish.
It would be sweet if you convert to Catholicism, things like that, but generally speaking, they welcome the arrival of these people.
Well, the welcome wears out rather fast because there are more and more of these angles coming into Texas to the point where they are starting becoming the majority.
And they don't really seem to be trying all the hard to assimilate.
In some way, the comments made in Mexico at the time are in hilarious 180 compared to what we are today regarding illegal immigration because in Mexico, the attitude is like, this time angles are they even trying to learn how to speak Spanish?
How long have they been here? They still speak only English?
You know, there's the feeling that they are becoming little too many for comfort. They are taking over.
So the Mexican government decided to make things a little harder for them in post-extra taxes. They also want to abolish slavery, which was something very popular among the angles in Texas.
And the result is that the Americans in Texas organize a militia to fight against the Mexican government, this happened in the 1830s.
And oddly enough, after a few battles back and forth, they are successful. They are able to declare independence because the Mexican army is not able to crush them.
So for a decade or so, things are a bit uneasy because what you have is that you have the text, the angles in Texas saying they are an independent republic.
The Mexican government saying that they are still part of Mexico, but they don't have the mass to force them to become part of Mexico again.
And the United States kind of sits on the sidelines waiting to decide what to do.
Almost 10 years later, in 1845, the United States recognizes a tax-assassin independent state, which angered Mexico to no end because they feel like, what do you mean an independent state?
These guys are a bunch of rebels, this is part of Mexico.
So both Mexico and the United States are piling troops along the border, hoping that the other guys will shoot first so they have a good excuse to start a war.
Eventually, somebody does.
So the Mexican American war lasts from 1846 to 1848.
And it will land with an American success and at the treaty, the results from here, the Treaty of Guadalupe Dago.
The United States will take ownership of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, parts of Utah, parts of Nevada, parts of Colorado, parts of Oklahoma, so a huge chunk of land that they take over.
Incidentally, maybe if nothing else for historical curiosity, interesting to know why the US decided to take over this lands, but not the rest of Mexico.
Some people are saying, hey, you know, we beat them. Why don't we take over all of Mexico?
And one of the arguments was, yes, but if we do that, then all the Mexicans will now become American citizens.
And due to the heavy racism in the United States at the time, the idea was like, do you really want all these brown-skinned people become American citizens?
How about instead we just take over those lands where there's a lot of lands and not that many people, you know, we want as much land as possible with as few Mexicans as possible?
And so that's where they decide to draw the line at a place where population density starts becoming a little heavier.
So in all the kind of way, racism saved Mexico.
In any case, long story short, back to American Indian things, these will affect American Indian life very heavily.
Because all these lands that were part of Mexico will now be part of the United States and the United States will be quite aggressive about taking ownership.
And we'll see some examples. So in 1848 is where the US takes over.
In that same year, gold is discovered in California, which will lead to the 1849 gold rush.
And this is where we're going to stop the narration for today.
So we're going to pick things back up with the transfer of California real estate away from Mexico and into the hands of the United States.
And we'll see the kind of impact that they will have on native life in California.
But that's waiting for you in the next lecture.
