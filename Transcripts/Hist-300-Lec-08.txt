Welcome to audio lecture number eight. Last time we finished off talking about the end of the Mexican American War and I started in 1848. The United States took cover a big chunk of land including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. And right now we're going to start off focusing specifically on what happened in California to the native population after the United States took over.
So let's talk a little bit about life in California. We already saw how California Indian tribes were hard hit by the missions for quite a while.
There will be even more hard hit by the gold rush.
The missions had cut their population in half over a period of almost a hundred, not quite a hundred years, maybe 80 years or so.
But by now so in 1848 you have about 150,000 American Indian peoples in California.
By the beginning of the 1860s there will be less than 30,000 American Indian peoples in California.
So just looking at the numbers you can understand that something really ugly takes place during that time, the moment the United States take over.
You know, I tend to hesitate to use the word genocide loosely because the idea of genocide is the idea of an intentional wipeout of a population.
You know, much of what happens between the natives and Euro-Americans is not genocide. It's ugly, can be weird, but it's not really genocide.
What happened in California fits the bill a lot more.
Because what you have is that you have entire towns that will sponsor what are known as Indian hunts.
You have the state of California will pay groups of volunteers to go out and kill Indians.
In some cases even offering bounties for the scalps that they bring in.
And there's no effort to be made to distinguish friendly native hostile native.
The idea is they all need to go, which is the textbook definition of genocide.
And some of the actors involved in these are pretty open that what they are doing is genocide.
Consider the words of the governor of California in 1851, Ph. Barnett.
He stated,
A war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct.
But that, like right there from the horses mouth, you have the idea that what they are engaging is a war of extermination, which is a long winded way of St. genocide.
Consider the kind of stuff that was printed in the newspaper at the time.
The Eureka Herald in 1853 wrote,
We hope that the government will render such aid as we'll enable the citizens of the north to carry on a war of extermination until the last red skin of these tribes has been killed.
Extermination is no longer a question of time.
The time has arrived.
The work has commenced.
A led the first man who says,
3T or peace be regarded as a traitor.
I could go on and on and on because there are so many examples of things like that.
But basically, to cut it simple, what happens is that the state of California supported these militias going out and wiping out entire villages.
And while the federal government officially never endorsed this, they will pay the government of California refunding them of any money they have spent for doing this stuff.
So indirectly, well actually not that indirectly, but even the federal government gets into this business because they are supporting a state government that's openly engaging in genocidal campaigns.
So the story is really ugly.
What happens in California is really nasty.
What end up happening is that eventually the federal government will decide to step in and put an end to the genocide.
By then, the vast majority of native people in California have been wiped out.
There's maybe 30,000 people left and they are given these tiny little reservations scattered around tremendous amounts of cultural loss.
A lot of the culture of the stripes die out when 80% of their people die.
You really don't hear about California Indian tribes until very recently.
And the only reason you hear about them recently is because they have casinos today and being in California close to some big cities, they can make banks.
So the California native casinos are very wealthy.
That's really the only reason why they even show up again.
Their invisibility from the late 1800s through much of the 1900s is due to them having been victims of genocide.
Now when you think about, there are things that, you know, if somebody tells you about some horrible things that happen somewhere else 500 years ago, it's like, yeah, it's horrible, but whatever.
This was something that was going on in the 1850s and 1860s in California.
It's not that long ago, you know, it's like a couple of people lifetimes.
And it wasn't happening somewhere else, it was happening literally right here under our feet where I'm recording right now.
So it's kind of too close for comfort. It's a really, really ugly story, which, interestingly enough, to this day, even most people who go to school in California,
never got weird about it. I would bet that most of you, even in California, history classes, were never the topic of what happens to the native population during the Gold Rush, just doesn't pop up.
And yet, and you know, you can see why, because it's a really ugly, dark story.
And personally, I don't understand it, because it's not like me or you were involved in genocide, so I don't really see what's so hard about acknowledging that something ugly happened.
But in many, many cases, you people being hesitant about coming to terms with the ugly pages in the history of their own nation.
And this is definitely one.
So how all of these affects all those tribes on the Great Plains?
Because what happens is that now the United States owns all the land east of the Mississippi, and now they own all of these land in the south, you know, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California.
And lots of people want to travel to California for the Gold Rush, but it's now really practical to go all the way south, and then, you know, many people want to be able to cut across from, let's say, the northeast to California.
That means having to travel through the Great Plains, which are still American Indian land.
So in 1851, the government, by distributing gifts to different tribes, they get one of the largest gathering of tribes ever in 1851.
And get them to sign the first Fort Laramie Treaty.
There will be a second treaty almost 30 years later. This is the first one in 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty.
What this treaty does, essentially, is this. The US will pay the tribes for the trouble, but the tribes will let American citizens travel and molested through their lands.
And most of the tribes are fine with it. They don't really mind. Their idea is, well, as long as you don't stop and to cover the land, if you keep going, sure, we don't mind if you travel through.
This is going to be nice, in theory, problematic, in reality.
Because what's going to happen is that the sheer numbers of people traveling through native lands are going to cause problems.
You're going to have some of these people who, you know, they let their cows graze and start eating most of the grass that the bison depend on, causing the bison herds to change their migratory patterns,
which become a real big problem for some of the tribes who rely on them. They may use a lot of firewood along the way, and there's not a whole lot of firewood to begin with on the Great Plains.
They will inevitably bring their own diseases with him, their own germs, which are going to spread to the tribes, killing a lot of people.
So, while the Forlarami Treaty is going to hold for a while, the initially warm feelings between natives on the Great Plains and Americans start getting, since they're getting a little ugly every year.
Plus, you have some people who decide to stop and set up a home somewhere in the area that's native lands.
So slowly but surely what was supposed to be a deal of, they'll just travel through when we give you some gifts become progressively more problematic.
So what the US will do is that they will approach those tribes that are most affected by American expansions.
The ones that are basically at the edge of the United States and feel more the pressure.
Tribes in Minnesota, the eastern part of South Dakota, places like this.
I'll give you guys an example of how reservations are created.
And you know, we're just going to use this one, but if you repeat the same story over and over again, it's kind of what happens in many, many different places.
But let's use the example of the Yankton tribe.
The Yankton were a subdivision of the Lakota or Sioux.
There are some different names for the same tribe.
And the Yankton were one of the subbands.
What happens in the 1850s is that the United States will approach the Yankton.
They will hire a guy, a veteran of Charles Pecote, to say, look, why don't you, Pecote was half blood.
It was part Yankton and part French.
And the US will hire this guy to try to convince the tribe to sell the land, to sign a treaty and sell the land.
So a few Yankton leaders go out to Washington.
And even that's interesting.
Why couldn't they just discuss the treaty on Yankton land?
Why get some of the leaders away from the tribe and bring them to Washington?
A lot of it was sheer intimidation.
Make them travel to a few big American cities.
Make them see how many people the United States has so that they will be more willing to say yes to whatever you propose to them.
Eventually, some of these leaders signed this treaty.
The Yankton Treaty signed in 1858.
And essentially what the treaty does is they sell, let's say, 90 to 95% of their land to the United States.
They will settle on this small little chunk of what they used to own, which will be called the reservation.
And in exchange for selling their, most of their land, the United States will take care of them for generations to come.
The way the understanding there is we are going to be taking your way of life, we're going to be taking your economy,
we're going to be taking your political independence. We're basically going to completely change our lifestyle.
But at least you still got to have a land base.
And you know, most native people were not enthusiastic about signing treaties like this because of course it's a bad deal.
But the way they saw it was these guys may take our land anyway.
Let's at least get something for it.
You know, let's, if we're not able to defeat the United States in war and stop them from taking the land, let's take at least the best deal we can.
Some people supported this idea among the Yankton, other people who are deeply opposed, they thought that this was selling out.
And these kind of dynamics happen unfailingly when people are given these bad choices.
It's like, do you want to give up your whole life and settle on 5% of your land and sure will take care of you for a while?
Or do you want to fight it out and will probably squash it?
And neither choice is a good one.
So different people in the tribes would fracture politically when faced with these ugly choices.
In any case, the treaties signed, other enough by the way, when they were meeting in Washington to sign the treaty, they were told that the water in Washington was really polluted and many native people died when they came there.
Only white people could drink the water because they were used to it.
So they should just drink a bunch of whiskey and then they would be safe.
Which was basically a way to keep them drunk the whole time so that they would be more malleable and it would be easier to convince them to sign.
One of the first agents for the Yankton reservation was a man by the name of Walter Burleigh.
Now what does it mean agent?
Well, the government, since they would have to settle this supplies aside for taking care of the tribe for a while,
they would have one of their own employees.
A government employee would become the agent of the reservation, basically the person who would oversee the distribution of all of these resources.
In this case, it's this guy by the name of Walter Burleigh.
What Burleigh does is very, very typical of reservation life.
What Burleigh does is try to start scheming every possible centic and that's supposed to go from the government to the tribes.
His job is going to figure out a way that that mannequed force into his pockets instead.
So for example, let's say that he charges the government for buying a hundred cows for the tribe.
He gave a fair market value for a hundred cows.
What he really did was find the hundred cheapest and sickest cows that were there barely alive,
so buy them for below market price and then pocket the difference.
Or, you know, he would charge the government for building a school among the Yankton, for the material, for the schoolteach,
and all of that.
And the reality is that no school was ever built.
This was just a way of creative accounting, you know, finding a way to again justify the fact that mannequed disappeared.
So what typically happened was you would have tribes who would get upset because they were promised this stuff.
They say, hey, we gave up all of our land, our way of life, but you said you would take care of us.
Where are the supplies?
The government agent would say, hey, it's Washington's fault.
Back in Washington, they didn't send us the goods.
Let me keep working on that.
When in Washington politicians who did about it, they may ask the reservation agent and they would say, well, you see how much I spent for these people.
They are just ungrateful.
They don't know what they are talking about.
And so essentially what ended up happening is that in the red tape of different government offices blaming one another,
American Indian peoples would get screwed over and they don't get what they were promised.
So in this process, lots of people made money.
The reservation agents being notoriously corrupt made money.
There was a whole long list of people who made money along the way.
You know, guys like Walter Burleigh left behind some documents where they clearly indicate that they were using some of the money to bribe
the senators and congressmen and everyone along the line so that they would turn a blind eye to what he was doing.
So long story short, reservations will for a long time be very, very corrupt places.
And American Indians would often get the short end of the stick.
In some cases, these kind of abuses could turn really ugly.
In Minnesota, among the Santit tribe, which was just next to the basically right next to the youngton.
They similarly got taken advantage of.
They did not get their supplies.
They were starving.
When they complained to the government agent, he replied to them saying, if you guys are hungry, that's not my problem.
Go eat grass.
The Santit didn't take it well.
So they decided to rebel in 1862 and launch what will become known as the Minnesota Prize.
So they go and kill a bunch of settlers who are now in their land trying to take their land back.
The idea being, you know, you promised us all these goods to give up the land.
You are not holding your hand over the bargain, so we're going to take the land back.
The army will come in to squash this rebellion and, you know, they will find one of the first people
that the Santia killed was the government agent who told them, if you guys are hungry, go eat grass.
And just to show that they had a sense of humor about it, the government agent will be found dead on the plains
with his mouth, stuffed with grass.
In any case, the rebellion will be crushed.
And at the end of it, some 38 Santi warriors will be hanged in the biggest legal mass execution
in US history.
You know, there have been times when maybe illegally was done.
There were more people.
But this is the one occasion in which the death penalty is being legally administered to the greatest number of people in US history.
38 people on the same day were hanged in Minnesota at the end of this uprising.
This lesson is not going to be lost on some of the tribes, Fortar West, who are going to see what happens
and they are going to decide to resist.
They are going to be a little less willing to sign a deal to settle on the reservation.
So this is something that we're going to be seeing next.
One quick thing I should mention before we continue is that much of the material that we're going to be covering
in the next bit, and possibly even in the next lecture.
They are going to be covered even considerably more detail in the crazy horserias and in the war for the Black Hills areas.
So I'm going to assume certain things that you guys are already familiar, so I'm not going to repeat the same things 12 times.
I'm just going to kind of focus on the essential things right here.
I should also mention that there's another podcast that I did not assign to you is not required for the course,
but if you are interested in this topic, it's definitely strongly recommended and it's easily available to you.
It's another episode of History on Fire that focuses specifically on the Sand Creek massacre that we'll be briefly discussing soon.
And it goes into a lot more detail regarding the cultural context, the Cheyenne tribe, what happened at the massacre and everything else.
That's episode number, I believe is, let me check it.
It is episode number 32A of the of History on Fire.
So the same place where you got the crazy horserias podcast, the War for the Black Hills podcast,
episode 32A, which is part one focuses on Sand Creek.
So check that out only if you want.
Again, it's not a sign, it's just an extra resource for you because you know the thing is I'm cutting things rather short sometimes.
I'm just trying to give you a bird eye view of American Indian history and some of the quick, more most essential facts.
But of course, I don't want to sacrifice in case you are really interested in the topic, I'm more than happy to give you guys more resources that you can tap into and check out.
So keep that in mind if that's something that you want to hear more about.
And instead that, let's continue on with our lecture.
So let's get going with what happens on the planes.
Well, basically what happens on the planes is that up until the early 1850s, the United States and the plane's tribes were in a state of relative peace.
Things begin to turn ugly in 1854 when supplies that the government that promised to some native tribes in order to let a bunch of American travelers travel through are not delivered in time.
And this was something that kept happening over and over for several years.
So in this one occasion, the specific incident is almost silly, but basically this one guy is traveling west as he swag on as he scows and one of his cows starts trying to further and further away.
And by the time he noticed that this is happening, the cow has gone into a Lakota camp.
The guy is too scared of American Indians to go in and claim it saying, hey, that's mine, but doesn't really want to let it go either.
So when the cow is found by the Lakota, they kill him and they kill the cow and eat it.
But the guy goes to complain to the closest army fort he can find.
And he runs into a young officer named Gretan who is quite excited at the prospect of having an excuse to be able to flex his muscles.
So Gretan takes about 30 some soldiers with him.
They go off to this Lakota camp.
And Gretan is basically openly threatening them that if they don't give up the person who killed the cow, all hell is going to break loose.
Negotiations turn a little ugly when the Lakota say, look, we'll pay you for the cow.
We'll give you horses, we'll give you blankets, you know, well, let's call it an honest mistake and be down with it.
But Gretan keeps insisting that the people who killed the cow need to be given up for punishment.
Since they're getting ugly, Gretan orders his troops to shoot on some of the Lakota leaders.
At that point, the rest of the Lakota close in on Gretan and his men and kill them all.
This first incident sets up the fighting.
There really will be some 20 plus years of fighting between some of the tribes on the Great Plains, the Lakota and Cheyenne in particular, versus the United States.
And it's not going to be, you know, constant fighting.
There will be breaks in this, but give or take, there's these opens what are known as the Plains Indian Wars.
And they are meaningful, they are a big deal, they continue for a long time.
Something that will further exurvey the problem is something that happens in Colorado in 1858.
Gold is discovering Colorado, leading to thousands of people wanting to move to Colorado for making money in the Gold Rush.
Most of Colorado is in the hands of a few tribes, in particular the Cheyenne and the Arapa.
And inevitably, things get a little tense when, you know, basically what happens is it's interesting, but you have both sides with accused one another of being thieves.
You know, the Cheyenne and the Arapa will accuse the Americans of being thieves for the obvious reasons that the Americans are taking over their lands.
The American settlers will accuse the Cheyenne and the Arapa of being thieves because the Cheyenne and the Arapa was beginning to retaliate, stealing horses, stealing mules, doing stuff like that.
It's almost inevitable that eventually things would turn ugly.
And by the beginning of the 1860s they do turn ugly as retaliation, counter retaliation, the whole thing starts escalating.
Now, when I say the Cheyenne, it's implying that there's one group and they all share, they speak with one mind.
The reality of tribal politics is that first a tribe like the Cheyenne will be made of several different villages who are political independent.
Even though they, you know, yes, they speak the same language, yes, they may be related, yes, they have the same culture, but politically speaking each village is independent.
So in this one occasion there was one of the Cheyenne leaders who was favoring staying at peace with the Americans, a guy by the name of Black Kettle.
They decided to visit the governor of Colorado and ask to say, he basically said, look, we want to have peace, we want to be left alone, what can we do?
The governor wasn't so happy because he had already invested a lot in trying to get open warfare going against the tribes, but, you know, he directs Black Kettle and his followers to talk with military authorities for Zion.
There the commander tells Black Kettle, look, grab this American flag, grab this white flag, put them up on your teepee, go camp over here so, you know, we know that you are friendly, and then all will be good.
The problem is that in the meantime, there's a Colorado militia that has been organized by the man, by the name of John Chivinton, and Chivinton was not a big fan of American Indians.
His idea was, what do you mean, friendly Indian and hostile Indian? They're all Indians, they all need to go.
They, so despite the fact that some of his own officers advise him against him, Chivinton decide to attack this peaceful Cheyenne village of Sancreek, which is funny because there were other Cheyenne villages who were very ready to fight and willing to fight.
He ends up attacking the ones who are for peace, which is sort of silly in a lot of ways.
By the time Chivinton and this man attacks Sancreek, you know, Black Kettle is there, which is American flag, his white flag, he's telling his people not to panic, no, don't worry because we'll, you know, they'll know that we are peaceful.
Chivinton doesn't care and proceed to massacre the people in the village.
The massacre it turns really ugly, not only because you have killed a whole bunch of people who are actually some of those trying to vie for peace, but also they'll proceed to just chop them to pieces, do all sorts of mutilations to the body, scalp them and go back to them for waving these trophies acquired during the Sancreek massacre.
The result of this is that these diminish tremendously the power of those natives who were vying for peace because the message is, you know, if a guy like Black Kettle was a peace chief got to be treated this way by the Americans, why would we even bother making peace?
More and more people begin to fall into the war camp.
Incidentally, it's interesting because there was a guy, a brand name of Silas Sol, who refused to, he was an officer at Sancreek, but he refused to let this man shoot on what he knew to be a defenseless village.
And he's going to accuse Chivinton of essentially war crimes.
And it's interesting because Sol will then be killed by one of Chivinton loyalists and it really shows that it shows the complexity of the situation.
You know, sometimes we think of all Americans that speak with one voice, Sol Cheyenne, speak with one voice, it's not like that.
There are a bunch of different Chivinton people, a bunch of different American people, who often were very much at odds with one another regarding what was the best course of action to follow.
In any case, the Sancreek massacre which took place in 1864, very much spurs tribes such as the Lakota and the Chivinton to build an alliance against the United States.
And so for the next period between 1864 and 1868, the fighting escalated dramatically.
There's a lot of Geria warfare for the following four years.
Sometimes this is referred to as the Red Cloud War, after the name of a particular Lakota leader.
This is probably highly exaggerated importance of this guy, Red Cloud.
But nonetheless, there's a lot of fighting that takes place and it's not going well for American troops.
It's very hard to chase these guys up and down the plains. It's very hard even to know where they are going to be next.
So what happens typically is that natives show up, kill a few soldiers, they run off, they do it again and the soldiers spend a lot of time chasing them around the plains without really being able to catch them.
There are even some major battles, like for example in Wyoming, the Cheyenne and Lakota have been harassing this one fort that have been built in the middle of their homeland.
So every day when the soldiers go out to Catwood or the other work, a few Lakota and Cheyenne will go into Shubdam and run away.
And in this one occasion, this group of Lakota and Cheyenne will be chased by a larger group of soldiers from the fort.
But what this small group of Lakota and Cheyenne were doing was leading them into an ambush, where these hundreds soldiers or so will be ambushed by over 1000 Lakota and Cheyenne will kill them all.
So long story short, this is shortly after the end of the Civil War. The United States has spent a ton of money on the Civil War.
They don't really want to keep fighting a war that's not going well.
So in 1868, the United States will agree to sign a second treaty of Fort Laramie, which is extremely beneficial for the tribes, because it's saying that the United States will be able to fight the war.
Not only with the Lakota and Cheyenne own most of South Dakota, but they will also have rights to lands in Montana and North Dakota and other places.
On top of it, all the forts being built in their homeland will be abandoned.
And on top of it, and even more important, none of these landbays can be sold to either the US government or to private citizens, unless 75% of tribal members are ready to sign.
The 75% is a huge number, because in the past, you could get a couple of guys' drunks, a hey your leader sign, tough luck, you guys now sold the land.
In saying that they will have to get 75% of the whole tribe to agree, this is giving tremendously good guarantees to the native side.
Now, the problem with this treaty, beside the obvious that in many cases they would translate the parts that were good for the natives and kind of skip over the parts that may not be as good for the natives, kind of giving a distorted perception of what they were actually signing.
But the main problem is the same problem that affects all treaties, which is eventually they all get broken.
And it kind of makes you wonder what even is the purpose of signing treaties if you mean to break them.
And largely what you can gather is that these treaties were signed to buy time.
In a case like these, things are not going well, the war is not going particularly well.
So the United States aside, why don't we take a break?
And we can sign a treaty that's very favorable to them, so they will sign and we can stop fighting.
And then when we are ready for it, when we fix a few other things we need to worry about, we can go back, break the treaty and start a war.
Which is exactly what's going to happen, because this treaty that was supposed to last forever and ever in real time in reality ends up being about six years.
Having said all that, the United States even six years later will have to deal with a real problem, which is how do you beat an enemy that you cannot find, because they don't give battle when you want.
They are not going to lay out on a field and just be ready.
They are highly nomadic, they are hard to catch.
The first round of war with these guys hasn't really gone super well, so what can you do to beat them?
So we are going to stop this lecture right now, kind of with this first phase of the wars on the Great Plains between the La Cote and Cheyenne and the United States.
We will pick up where we left off, but for today that's good enough. Thank you guys for listening and I will catch you in the next one.
