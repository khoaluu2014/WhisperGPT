Now much of the history of American Indian lives in the 20th century is the history of, I mean, it's not just the history of, but it's definitely heavily affected by government policies to our native peoples.
And government policies to our native peoples keep changing back and forth depending on losing power.
Typically, you're going to find Republican administrations pushing more heavily toward a simulation and democratic ones than usually allowing a little bit more sovereignty for native peoples.
So far we've only seen the assimilation side.
Since begin to change during the presidency of Franklin and Roosevelt, who was president between 1932 and 1945, in case you're thinking you're doing the math wrong, it's like, why was this guy president for so long?
Back then there was no requirement that you could only run twice, so Roosevelt actually won four different elections.
Roosevelt appointed as commissioner of Indian affairs, which was the highest government job and the head of the bureaucracy overseeing the relationship between the US government and the tribes, he appointed a name by the name of John Collier.
Collier came to this job with a completely different outlook on native cultures compared to his predecessors.
Collier believed that there was something valuable in native American culture, something worth protecting.
So, rather than pushing heavily toward getting rid of native culture, Collier started wanting to protect them somewhat.
So, he was able to push through Congress, a piece of legislation shortened as IRA that stands for Indian Reorganization Act.
The Indian Reorganization Act, also known as the Indian New Deal, basically did a few things.
A well-level put an end to the Doze Act, and it allowed the tribes that wanted to keep their lending common to do so.
And in the process it even gave some land back to the tribes, not nearly as much as it was taken from them, but definitely mattered nothing.
The other thing that the Indian Reorganization Act did was to offer the tribes a chance to organize their own tribal government.
So, rather than having a government agent overseeing the whole process, the tribe could elect its own tribal members and they would then mediate with Washington, and they would constitute the tribal government.
Oddly enough, there was a position to the IRA, while there was the obvious one. You'd figure the people who have been pushing for a simulation all along are horrified.
The Collier seemed to be a reverse instance, and is given the tribes more sovereignty.
But at the same time, also some very traditional natives were usually the enemies of the people pushing for a simulation.
They kind of sided with them opposing the IRA.
Why? Well, a couple of reasons.
For one, how many times have traditional natives been told they just signed this document coming from Washington, and everything is going to be great, only to get horribly screwed over in the process?
A lot. So by now they are distrustful of anything coming from Washington.
Step two is the fact that there were a couple of problems in the IRA.
The Indian Organization Act was based on the model of American democracy, was based on the majority rule idea.
You got 51% you got to rule.
Traditional natives worried that this was different from their own system.
Their idea was that you rule by consensus.
If you become a leader, you need to figure out a compromise that works for everybody.
You cannot just think of pleasing, even a thin majority and forgetting about the minority.
You have to work for the whole tribe.
Whereas in a representative democracy, you don't have to work for the whole tribe.
You just have to please enough people to be reluctant.
That's it.
Not only that, but because your time in office is limited, you may be thinking about short-term solutions and not really thinking long-term.
Those are the two main criticisms of the IRA that you will encourage factionalism and short-term thinking.
And both of them are true.
There's no argument.
It's hard to say what else could have been done that would have been better.
The IRA in some way, many people see it as a step in a nice direction,
definitely compared to what was going on in terms of government policy prior to it,
but still far from ideal.
There will be some of these problems that result from the IRA.
In any case, Collier will remain in power as long as Roosevelt is in power.
So these changes will start being implemented and they will, in some way, govern policy to our native people is like a pendulum.
It swings a bit one way, then somebody else comes in power, it swings the other way, then it goes back and forth like this.
So now you have a swing more towards sovereignty.
At the end of this time of Collier being in office in the 1940s,
the United States will get into World War II.
And there are few really interesting stories that involve native people in World War II.
I'll mention at least three of them.
One is more symbolic than anything.
It involved the Eurocoid nation.
When World War II broke out, the Eurocoid tribal council declared war on Germany.
Meaning we Eurocoid nation joined the United States in opposing Germany and Japan.
Symbolically speaking, it was a big deal because they were saying we are independent and we just stepped into joining the United States.
Now in practical terms, of course, they're soldiers, we're US soldiers, but they were trying to kind of serve their sovereignty a little.
Another story that has more of a more meaningful kind of practical effect involves what are known as the Code Talkers.
Primary for the Navajo or Dine tribe.
Dine is how they call themselves.
Navajo is out there most popularly known by outsiders.
A few other tribes as well, but Navajo are the main ones.
So what happened with these guys?
During the war with Japan, the United States had a big, big problem because the Japanese were incredibly skilled at intercepting American communication and breaking them down and breaking whatever code they were using for to pass orders back and forth.
The Japanese would break those codes really fast, which is obviously really bad news in a war when your enemy knows what you're telling to one another.
So they would come up with a more complicated code and the Japanese would break it down again and more complicated, you know, didn't matter.
The Japanese could break any code that the US came up with.
So somebody in a idea, somebody said, you know what, about this?
What if we get, you know, yes, they can break codes because they are really good at breaking codes and we speak English and they have people who speak English.
But what if we get on the radio, people who speak a language that no one in Japan speaks?
What if we get American Indian people talking to each other, you know, they are in the army, they are serving in the army, and they are in charge of the radio and they talk to one another in their tribal language?
What would happen then?
Well, it's worth a shot.
Let's try.
So they do that.
And the first time the Japanese intercept communication, they started in primarily was the Navajo language because the Navajas were one of the largest tribes in the United States and among the largest one were the ones that had the highest percentage of people who still spoke the language, about 50% of the Navajo still speak the tribal language.
So there were a lot of people to pick from.
So the Japanese intercept communication, they get to hear these voices, speaking in a language, and you know, nobody speaks Navajo in Japan, so the code that they use remained unbroken for the remainder of the war, which gave a huge advantage to the United States.
It was a very helpful kind of thing.
Now, of course, there's a bit of a bit of an irony in this story because as you may imagine, you know, these are the same people who probably have been in the United States.
People who probably went to boarding schools when they are kids and got beat up for speaking their tribal languages.
The US government still at this time and in place policies that were driving American Indian languages into extinction.
And then while that was happening, American Indian languages ended up being a huge help to the United States during the war.
So yeah, definitely a little bit of a bitter iron in there.
A happier story involves this one guy, but in the name of Joe Madison Crow.
Joe Madison Crow was a member of the Crow tribe and he became the last war chief of the Crow tribe.
Because the Crow has had four requirements that you had to satisfy in order to become a war chief.
You had to touch an enemy battle.
You had to lead a successful raid.
You had to do all these things.
I forgot the third one actually, but the fourth one, that's an interest.
Oh, I think you had to capture an enemy, a weapon from an enemy.
And the fourth requirement, which was the hardest one to pull off in modern warfare, is that you had to steal horses from an enemy.
That made perfect sense back in the day when raiding for horses was at the very heart of native warfare.
But not exactly too many people in World War II were running around on horses.
So Joe Madison Crow goes off to war during World War II.
He's able to do the other things.
He does lead a successful raid.
He's able to take a weapon from an enemy.
In one particular occasion, he runs into a German soldier and just knock him out.
He's about to kill him when the German soldiers are crying for his mom.
And Joe Madison Crow is like, I can't shoot a guy who's crying for his mom.
So he spares him, not killing him.
So again, that's the third requirement.
But good luck satisfying the fort.
Well, one day Joe Madison Crow is part of this unit in France.
And as they are progressing through France, they arrive in this farm that's occupied by German soldiers.
And the German soldier has seized everything on the farm, including a whole bunch of horses.
So here you have this, the Nazi army with a bunch of horses in their hands.
And Joe Madison Crow just cannot believe his eyes.
He's like, really? Do I really have a chance to pull this off?
So he asks his commanding officers to give him some time.
He says, before we attack, can you please give me a few minutes to just try something?
So his neck behind enemy lines, he gets into the corral with all the horses.
Freedom without being seen by the Germans.
So he's able to get into the corral, steal the horses.
And before you know it is there screaming and yelling, celebrating while German soldiers are still shooting at him.
And he's running off leading these horses into a stampede.
So by the time he got back home in Montana where the Crow reservation is,
and he started telling his elders about everything he had done,
his elders started doing the math and they are like, hey, you did them all.
You did all the things they are required to do to become a war chief.
So Joe Madison Crow became the last war chief of the Crow tribe during World War II.
Follow in the end of World War II, the pendulum swings back the other way again.
A policy, the new policy toward American Indians will become known as termination.
And termination is made up of several different parts.
One end, termination is literally the idea of terminating the special status of tribes
and turning their lands into just private property.
Saying, hey, we're done having this relation to nation relationship.
If you guys are doing well enough economically, goodbye, you're on your own.
The result of that is punishing the tribes that are world-win better.
Economically speaking, and almost unfailingly, when the federal government pulls out its support,
they do that clearly too soon and these tribes start collapsing economically.
So that's one aspect of it.
Part of termination is also encouraging urbanization.
It's trying to convince as many American Indians as possible to leave the reservation
and relocate to the cities.
Because of course it's going to be easier to eventually then close down reservations
as few people live on them.
And this shift is significant.
In 1950, only 13% of American Indians lived in urban centers.
By 1990, that's 63%.
So you go from a tiny minority to a solid majority.
Another aspect that's related to termination is the creation of something known as the
Indian Clay Commission in 1946.
The Indian Clay Commission on the surface, it looks like it's a pro-native thing.
It really isn't.
Technical, the Indian Clay Commission is a tribunal, it's a court, set up to deal with
native grievances over broken treaties, stolen land and stuff like this.
And the rationale for doing was we need to wipe the slate clean with the past
or these guys are going to keep whining forever about the broken treaties and these.
Let's just settle these ones and for all.
There are a couple of structural problems with the Indian Clay Commission.
The first problem is a conflict of interest.
The defendant in this case is the US government.
And the judge and jury are appointed by the US government.
And they're kind of like, you know, you say that I stole your car and we go to my
uncle to decide whether that's true or not.
It's a little shady.
Also, the fact that even if a tribe could win a case, the best you could hope for was money.
And in some cases, that's not what tribes want.
They want their land back.
And that becomes a real issue with the Indian Clay Commission.
There's a famous case that come out of the Indian Clay Commission that involves the black
heels of South Dakota.
If you guys recall from earlier lectures, the black heels were taken illegally in violation
of the four Laramie Treaty.
And so the Lakota and Cheyenne sued and they are going to be in court forever.
Writers case after case going back and forth, eventually this thing drags on for decades.
By 1980, the case reaches the US Supreme Court.
And the Supreme Court says, yeah, sorry about that.
It was an obvious case of breaking a treaty.
You're right.
It was your land.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It is some money to make up for it.
And this is where the story gets really interesting.
Lakota people are some of the poorest people in the United States.
And yet they decide to reject the money.
They say, we don't want the money.
We want the land back.
Supreme Court say, well, that's not the way it works.
We are not equipped to give land back.
Only Congress can give land back.
We can just give you money.
The Lakota decide not to touch the money because they realize that the only thing that could
ever give them the black heels back is public support and public support would obviously
vanish if they take the money.
There would be a lot less sympathy for it.
So they try to petition the Congress.
They ask a Democratic senator, but you know, Bill Bradley, to introduce a piece of legislation
that, you know, it's actually kind of a moderate piece of legislation because what it does is
not saying we're going to return all of the black heels is saying we are going to return
only those parts of the black heels that are in the hands of the federal government or the state,
not if they are in the hands of private citizens.
So you don't have to deal with the nightmare of trying to take land or houses where people
bought their private land.
We're only talking national forest or state park or stuff like that.
So that seems fair enough.
Well, it is the problem though.
Despite the fact that this seems such a mellow kind of approach, they are not going to be successful with it.
You know, by the time the guy was about to introduce the bill doesn't even bother introducing it
because he will start asking around, he realizes there is zero support in the Senate for this.
And the reason it's simple is because if you start returning land to American Indian tribes
on the basis that the land was stolen, well, might as well pack up the bag and head back to wherever
your ancestors were from because the whole continent was stolen, right?
So Congress doesn't want to go down that path.
And so we are in this really weird situation where since then the Lakota's key to refusing the money
and Congress is clearly nowhere closer today to giving back the Black Hills than they were in the 1980s
but the Lakota approach is a were patient.
This is ultimately what we really want is the land back.
You know, the Black Hills are not for sale.
We want our second lands back.
And the story.
And so it's a really interesting tale where they win the case, but they don't get the land
and yet they still keep waiting for the land refusing to take the money.
Part of the reason I'm going to anticipate an objection, some of you may be thinking,
why not take the money and use it to buy land in the Black Hills, which makes perfect sense, right?
Well, here is the problem.
One, the price of land would skyrocket if it was well known that the tribes have billions of dollars to spend.
B, whatever land you buy would become private property.
Private property and like reservation land, you have to pay property taxes on it.
So it's very considering that the economy of most tribes is not super stable.
It's very likely that they could get the land back, they could buy it, and then they wouldn't be able to afford property taxes
and they would lose it again.
So really no water risk.
So that's basically the setup.
Incidentally, the one, there's one place in the Black Hills that's in the hands of the federal government.
They were not going to give anyway, but one of the most famous national monuments is in the Black Hills,
and that's Mount Rushmore.
The faces of the precedence sculpted into the mountain.
And think about how weird, you know, how symbols can mean very different things to different people.
Mount Rushmore is a perfect example of the ambiguity of symbols.
You know, Mount Rushmore is visited by over 2 million people a year, who consider the place one of the prime symbols of patriotism.
The sculpture itself is sometimes nicknamed the Shrine of Democracy.
People go there with hand on their heart and in their mind, Mount Rushmore represents freedom and democracy.
But think of it from a native perspective.
Here you have what's your sacred land?
Some people stole it from you in violation of treaties.
They then use dynamites to blast your sacred mountains to put the faces of their leaders in it and refer to it as a symbol of freedom and democracy.
Needless to say, if you're not the first ones that come to your mind when talking about Mount Rushmore,
you see them as to you, Mount Rushmore is a symbol of colonialism, of theft, of oppression.
So it doesn't really mean the same thing.
It is also funny that originally, Mount Rushmore, when he was first sculpted, was conceived as a monument to manifest destiny.
You know, why those four guys is because they were considered the four guys who contributed the most to the expansion of the United States.
And the guy who sculpted Mount Rushmore was actually a KKK member.
But you know, back then, when they were doing the work, the kind of ideology was more accepted.
Today, not so much.
So I guess the story of Mount Rushmore is an interesting example of how sometimes symbols can mean very different things to different people.
You know, the symbol is the same, but the values associated with it are quite different, depending on who's looking.
In any case, let's look at another rather big topic.
It's a very important topic of the second half of the 20th century in American Indian history.
And this is the topic of American Indian activism.
The 1960s and 1970s are powerful, re-important decades that hashed around era of change in American history.
The same holds true for American Indian peoples.
Because basically what happens is that, you know, for generations, American Indians has been politically active all along.
It's not that they suddenly discover doing this in the 60s and 70s.
But the kind of political activism prior to this was a little more trying to work with the system, for the most part.
You know, for generations, native leaders are trying to work with the government, negotiating, trying to have meetings, trying to do things to improve the conditions of living for native peoples.
The generation coming of age in the late 60s, early 70s is kind of impatient with their parents and grandparents' tactics.
They feel that how many meetings do we have to go to before we actually do see some change?
They had seen in the early 60s, they had seen the right and late 50s for the matter, and early 60s, they had seen the rise of the Civil Rights Movement.
They had seen other organizations for different ethnic groups, for example, the emergence of groups like the Black Panthers Party,
where we took this approach, which you can probably refer to as confrontational politics.
You know, what the Black Panthers would do is they would stage some dramatic confrontations that would catch the media attention and put their issues in the spotlight.
For example, one thing that the Black Panthers used to do, take an issue like police brutality, for example, racial profiling.
Rather than putting on a demonstration or complaining about it in the mid- you know, they, the Black Panthers would very simply wait for a police car to come into their neighborhood.
Then they would follow the car.
And when the cops who get out of the car with their arrest somebody or questioned somebody, four, five, six Black Panther Party members would get out of the car with guns in hand and look at what the police was doing.
This by the way was perfectly legal because one of the reasons why laws were changed regarding carrying loaded guns in cars is because the Black Panthers were doing it legally, and it scared the police.
So what happens is why did the Black Panthers do it because they capture media attention? You know, nobody cares if you're running a news media organization and you know your job is to make sure that people are staying, sitting through the commercial until what happens next.
And right before you cut for the commercial break you say, when we come back a group of African American activists are going to, we're going to follow the story of a group of African American activists complaining about racial profiling.
Most people are going to switch and it's boring. There's no excitement there.
There's only people are already into the topic are going to want to eat it. Otherwise there's no entertainment factor.
And granted, this is may sound superficial and weird, but that's the reality of people watching TV a lot of the time.
If on the other end, right before you cut to the commercial break you can show some couple of images of young Black Panther Party members in their Black Leather Jackets with their shotgun in hand and dark shades facing off with the cops.
Now you have something to hook the audience with. They will see to the commercial break because there's the possibility of violence. There's some drama.
There's some, you know, the basic things that capture people attention.
So that's what some native people started seeing all around them. You know, different ethnic groups were trying to have their grievances or in a more dramatic fashion.
And the younger American Indians, particularly in the cities were learning this lesson.
And so you start seeing this in the creation of organizations like the American India Movement, which was created very much modeled on the Black Panther Party, was created in 1968.
A group that was not the American Indian Movement, was related to the American Indian Movement, which by the way for short is usually referred to as AIM, was a group called the Indians of all tribes who took an important stance that drove native issues in the spotlight in 1969 when a community center in San Francisco for native people burned down.
And the city was dragging its feet about rebuilding.
So a group of young American Indian activists decided to go to Alcatraz Island, pull up a treaty that said that any federal land that was no longer being used by the federal government could go back to the tribes and say, hey, this was a federal planetensory. It's no longer being used.
In 1969, it wasn't used as a museum either or a tourist attraction. It was nothing. You know, there was this empty land with one caretaker. That was it.
So this group of guys say, well, give it to us.
And of course the government said, no, it won't. But this is the difference from the past that this young group of guys decide to physically take over the place.
And the government doesn't really know how to react because if they send the police and try to kick them out, there are a lot of people in the San Francisco area who are sympathetic to these guys.
So if on TV you show police beating these guys up to kick them out of the place, it may not look good.
On the other hand, you don't want to give them Alcatraz either. So often the government would just kind of sit back and try to buy time.
So what happens is that more and more people come to Alcatraz, Alcatraz will become this symbolic call for American Indian rights.
In practice, they're not going to get anything because eventually after a year and an half occupation, they will end up leaving the place when it becomes clear that the government is not going to give in.
But for a year and an half, they captured the headlines. So that was kind of a big deal.
The American Indian movement also started stepping in on some local issues. Like in certain states where racism was fairly heavy.
It was common for native people to end up getting killed by white people.
And the perpetrators either not being charged with anything or being charged with not with murder but with much lesser charges like second-degree manslaughter.
So wasn't that unusual for somebody to kill for a white man to kill a native person and get maybe at most two years in jail, five years in jail, something like that, if that.
So in one of these occasions, the relatives of a man from the Pine Ridge reservation named Raymond the Aleutander, they called the American Indian movement.
And the American Indian movement came in and raised the big deal confronting the prosecutor about tapping the charges to something a little more meaningful.
They did the same thing in another case for another native victim at the end of a white guy.
And during the confrontation that followed the police, you know, after the prosecutor say, I'm not up in the charges and they try to kick out members of the American Indian movement, those members of him ended up burning down the courthouse to the ground.
So the message there was that these guys were radical. They were not above taking action.
Which is going to be a double-edged sword because on one end they will get the reputation for being hot ads.
On the other end, they will capture media attention in a way that native people have been unable to do for generations.
One big event for the American Indian movement took place in 1972, something known as the Trail of Broken Treaties.
The Trail of Broken Treaties is a demonstration that came stages in Washington, D.C. protesting all the treaties that the government had signed and had broken.
In itself the demonstration wouldn't catch anybody's eye.
It does become a big deal though when they show up at the building of the Board of Indian Affairs or BIA, you know, the government branch that deals with American Indians,
entered the building, kicked out all of the employees and physically take over the place.
The police is sent to try to kick them out. They get into a fight with them. The American Indian movement is able to keep them out.
And for five days they will hold this federal building.
1972 is an election year and the Nixon administration doesn't want to deal with the drama.
So they offered them a deal. They say, look, we are not going to review your demands
while you are holding a government building.
But if you leave, we are going to review your demands and we promise that we are not going to prosecute anybody.
So they agree, the government will honor its word about not prosecuting everybody.
They will also honor their word about reviewing demands.
Now that doesn't mean much because they will say, okay, we'll review your demands.
We disagree.
So, you know, they don't really get much out of the Trail of Broken Treaties except for a whole lot of publicity.
By this point, trouble was brewing on a reservation in South Dakota.
In the Pine Ridge reservation, there was kind of a split.
There was almost a civil war setup because you had, on one end, the head of the tribal government was a man by the name of the city.
In the name of Dick Wilson, who ruled Pine Ridge with an iron end.
He was sort of a dictator in the sense that he used the government funds to finance his own private army.
What he referred to as his goon squad and goons was an acronym for Guardians of the O'Gala Nation but of course, also the English term goons.
So he was making a funny joke about it.
It wasn't much that was funny about the goons other than that because they were at that squad.
They were used to intimidate, to beat up and sometimes to flat out murder political opponents.
So the situation on Pine Ridge was fairly harsh and what you had was Dick Wilson and the supporters on one side.
And on the other side, the more traditional natives allied with the young guys from the American Indian movement.
The reason why Wilson hated the American Indian movement is because Wilson was ready to sell anything that was a nail to a wall to the US government.
Whereas the more traditional natives wanted to hold on to the land.
So the two sides didn't exactly see eye to eye.
Needless to say, the US government like Wilson a lot more than the American Indian movement simply because of the fact that Wilson was willing to sell land.
In particular on Pine Ridge where Uranium deposits, the US government was very interested in.
Whereas the folks from AIM didn't want to sell.
So not surprisingly, the US government sided with the Wilson guys against the American Indian movement.
This confrontation became fairly heated in 1973 when the American Indian movement decided to physically take over the site of Wounded Knee.
If you recall from earlier lecture, Wounded Knee had been the location of the last major massacre done by the US Army against an American Indian tribe.
It's the place where some 300 Lakota died. But you know, Wounded Knee, there's not a whole lot. There are a few houses.
There's a church. There's the mass grave from 1890.
But symbolically Wounded Knee was a big deal because he was the place where supposedly was the end of the Indian wars.
Well, the American Indian movement goes back there. Some nearly 300 members of AIM go back to Wounded Knee to physically take over the place.
Now immediately panic kicks in when the government over reacts a bit. They send the FBI, they send National Guard, they send the Quillstone, they send the Gun squad, they even send the Army.
He's deployed.
And for 71 days, this is going to be top national news. You have this 300 armed AIM members holding the place against the federal government.
Every so many days, they sit down to negotiate. Every so many days, negotiations break down and they shoot at each other.
Then they start negotiating again and you know, this game is played day in and day out for 71 days.
Keep in mind, there are by the way some images in the power points from that time from Wounded Knee. So maybe interesting for you to check them out.
What's interesting about it is when you consider that American Indians are roughly about 1% of the total population of the United States.
What that means is that most Americans do not have daily interaction with native peoples. The way they know anything about native peoples is from the media.
And in the media, the media most of the time doesn't really cover native issues.
So in the mind of most America in 1973, American Indians don't even exist.
They are the kind of thing that most you see in John Wayne movies, that's it.
All of a sudden you turn on TV and you see these young armed native Americans making a big deal about corongrivences.
This is a big wake up call to lots of Americans.
There are still American Indians, we didn't kill them all. It's a surprise.
So aim is successful in an unbelievable way in capturing the nation's attention for those 71 days.
Now eventually the government offered the same deal as they had for the Trail of Broken Treaties.
Leave and we'll review your demands. And by the way their demands were the same about what happened to all the treaties that were broken.
And the other one was a stop supporting the decuelson regime that's using money and weapons to murder political opponents.
So those were the two key demands. And the government say we'll review your demands and we will not prosecute you if you live now.
Aim realizes that the government is beginning to push the media further and further away, requiring them to shoot from further.
And the only thing that has been keeping them alive for 71 days is the media.
Because if the cameras were not rolling, it would be a lot easier for the government to come in and wipe them out.
So at that aim agrees to this deal. The deal and almost like the other one, the government will review the demands, say yeah we don't agree by.
And they will actually prosecute a few people. So this time they will break their word.
So on a practical level, they don't really accomplish anything that they wanted to accomplish.
But on another level, they are super successful at capturing media attention and offering a new degree of understanding of contemporary native issues to more people in the United States.
Now the history of the American Indian Movement in the 1970s is impossible to talk about without talking about the FBI.
The FBI, as you guys know, is the federal borough of investigation.
It's a federal police force is not limited to one town or one state.
They investigate only major crimes and in that capacity they have done great work.
They have taken down major criminal organizations, serial killers, you name it.
There's however another side to the FBI history that's a little less pleasant, which is what we're going to be dealing with today.
And it's the role that the FBI has played in the US history as a political police.
The FBI has gone long before the American Indian Movement. The FBI used the certain tactics to go after anybody that they considered politically troubling.
Including people, I mean, the more extreme examples, even people like Martin Luther King became targets of the FBI.
There are still letters written by FBI agents sent to Martin Luther King, inviting him to kill himself, saying,
you know, we have Doug Appel, this dirt about you specifically, they were referred to Martin Luther King relationships with some prostitutes.
We have Doug Appel, this dirt about you are going to let everybody know you better kill yourself now to spare yourself the shame.
And, you know, why was the FBI going after Martin Luther King with a vengeance? I mean, Martin Luther King is not, you know, your stereotypical terrorist or something.
He's a guy who used no violent means to bring more racial equality. It hardly seemed like a crazy concept.
The problem is he was altering the status quo political in the United States, and clearly if you are enjoying the benefits of the current status quo, you don't want it to change.
So the government didn't like anybody who was changing the status quo, including people like Martin Luther King.
So you can only imagine with people like him, who are actually a bit more radical than Martin Luther King.
The FBI had a program to deal with anybody they considered a political threat. This problem was called COINTELTRO, which was designed to neutralize any group or individual they considered a threat.
The tactics that they used in COINTELTRO were from borderline illegal to completely illegal. Let's look at some of them.
On a mild end of the scale, they would try to get the media to write an FBI-friendly version of events, putting in a bad light, whoever the FBI wanted to be put in the bad light.
And the FBI would accomplish this by giving preferential access to information to any journalist who was willing to do their bidding.
Okay, so far so good. They would also infiltrate some of these movements. Now, undercover work is standard. There's nothing even illegal about it, but this is where you would get a bit troubling.
Not just infiltrate to gain information, but they would infiltrate to convince members of some of these organizations trying to convince them to break the law.
Now, why in the world would the FBI want you to break the law? The FBI is in charge of preventing crime, of stopping crime.
Well, it's kind of hard to justify going after somebody because you don't like their political opinions, but if you can push them to break the law, boom, now you have a good excuse to do it.
Another tactic was to infiltrate these movements to start spreading gossip, to create internal tensions among members of the group.
So, for example, one typical thing is that the FBI would try to make it like a legitimate member of these groups was really an FBI informer.
In the case of the American Indian Movement, for example, there was a lady by the name of Anna Mae Equash.
The FBI tried to recruit her. She refused. They said, we're going to make you look like you're an informer, whether you like it or not. She still refused.
About a year later, she was found dead on the Pine Ridge reservation.
The FBI supervised an autopsy of her body, and they said that she died of exposure, meaning she wandered off and froze to that.
Her family thought that's just really weird, doesn't make any sense. So, they had a body exhumed, they did their own independent autopsy, and find out that the FBI supervised one and managed to miss a bullet hole in the back of her head.
Somebody had executed their point blank style.
What had happened was one of two things.
When the FBI started making her look like an informer, possibility number one, which is what seems to have quite a bit of evidence today, is that some members of the American Indian Movement thinking that she was an informer killed her.
Possibility number two is that some members of the American Indian Movement thinking that she was an informer stopped protecting her, so she was a more vulnerable target for Dick Wilson-Goon squad who found her a murder.
In either case, the FBI didn't kill her, but they set emotion a sequence of events that did lead to her death.
Here is another one. The harassment arrest were one of the most successful FBI tactics.
What exactly were harassment arrests? Harassment arrests were basically, you know, they would charge people with crimes that they didn't commit, and even if they had next to no evidence, the idea was just to charge them so that they would have to hire a lawyer and go to court, try to prove that in no sense.
Many of these charges, because they were based on nothing, wouldn't even go to trial. Some of them would go to trial.
Very, very rarely if by some random luck you could get away with you could actually get a conviction.
But that wasn't the point. You know, 90% of these charges didn't go anywhere.
Even if 100% wouldn't have led to conviction, the FBI strategy would have still been successful.
Which seems weird, because how can it be successful if you are not getting convictions? Well, getting convictions was a plus, was not the purpose.
The purpose was to tie up these people in court, to make them spend time, money, and energy hiring lawyers and going to court so that these would be time, money, and energy that they don't have to dedicate to political organizing.
There's a very famous case involving the clash between the American Indian Movement and the FBI.
The Leonard Peltier case, which resulted in a shootout between members of the American Indian Movement and the FBI.
The super famous case that resulted from it, which is still considered some people, considered Peltier a murderer, and that he was convicted and rightfully doing his time.
Other people argue that he was framed, and this is a political case, so he's a political prisoner.
In any case, the point being, the FBI was very successful with this tactics, and so they were able to bring down the American Indian Movement.
They were able to eventually take a lot of steam from their organizing.
So even though the American Indian Movement still exists to this day, the bone-cy version of what it was in the 1970s, when it was a pretty big political force.
The thing that's worth remembering about the American Indian Movement is that its legacy is complicated, because on one end, yes, they usually did not accomplish the things that they set themselves out to do.
On the other end, they did, they were able to achieve two major results.
One, in the 60s and 70s, a much greater percentage of native peoples rediscover interest in their traditional cultures.
This is part of the way in which they are not the only ones, but they contributed to creating a cultural climate in which people rediscover a sense of pride in American Indian identity.
And on another level, for everyone else, they exposed a lot more people to native issues, and so it may or may not be coincidence that then starting from the late 1970s forward, the lows being passed affecting American Indians at this tendency to be a lot more favorable than they used to be before.
So that's, I guess, more than one way to look at the legacy of the American Indian Movement.
Having said all that, we will wrap up for this particular lesson.
