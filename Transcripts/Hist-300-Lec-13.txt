Welcome to lecture number 13. Today we are going to be doing something different,
rather than just looking at chronologically what happens in the 90s and 2000s and so on.
I'm just going to look at some contemporary issues of how in the last few decades have
affected native life. So we're going to look issue by issue as opposed to decade by decade.
One big issue affecting native communities is the issue of access to land. Specifically,
back in the 17 and 18 hundreds when different pieces of land were selected to become reservations.
These were typical pieces of land that were considered worthless. That the government
did not have a high priority on acquiring, so they figured let's give them to American
Indians the way we don't deprive ourselves of good stuff. The problem for the government
is that some of these pieces of land turn out to be more valuable than expected because
in some cases there may be resources underneath the ground that are useful. Things like oil,
coal, uranium, stuff like that. Now, there are, so what happens is that there would be
energy companies who are interested in getting access to these resources, usually working
with the government. Occasionally, they would approach some tribes, you know, this
can work in a bunch of ways. The typical thing would be that you first approach a tribe and
try to make a deal with them. And sometimes the tribal government will say yes, the people
of the reservation will say yes, boom, done deal. For example, in the 1950s, a uranium mining
company approached the people of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico saying that they had discovered
uranium under the land in Laguna Pueblo, they would very much like to dig it. And if the tribe
gave permission to this, the company would give not only would pay money for this, but they would
also give most of the mining jobs to the people from the reservation. So these would dramatically
improve the economic standing of the reservation. People on the reservation thought that makes
sense. So let's do it, you know, or kind of poor, this could bring some much needed money. Let's do
it. So for about 30 years from 1952 to 1981, the uranium mine at Laguna was open. And initially
looked good, people were making way more money than ever before. They were, however, some problems.
Problem number one is that the uranium mining process wasn't quite as safe as advertised.
So the rate of cancer and bird effects started a sky rocketing on the reservation after this.
You know, originally when the company had met with the tribe, they said, don't worry, our scientists
say that the process is completely safe. There's nothing to worry about. Well, turn out there was
a little bit to worry about. The other issue is that after 30 years when the mine closed down,
it's not exactly like the people from Laguna could go back to doing the stuff they used to do before,
because making a living as a farmer in a marginal environment that's fairly harsh like that requires
some pretty specific knowledge. And for 30 years, most of the people at Laguna being involved in
the mining business. So there was really a lot of the knowledge was lost. So it's not that you
could really go back to the way it was. But in either case, you know, this was a free choice.
Nobody put a gun to their head forcing them to. So this is a case in which the tribe accepted the
deal. There are also cases where the tribe may not really be too keen on the deal. But if you put
enough money into the pockets of the people on the tribal government, the tribal government may agree.
So for example, the Navajo reservation in Arizona, despite quite a bit of opposition,
the Peabody coal company has been able to dig for coal for a really long time. And again,
this has kind of peaked sometime, the people from the tribal government against the people,
some of the other people in the tribe. And kind of in the same way as they were trying to set
up a deal with the quilsons for resources and despite opposition from much of the pine
reger's reservation, you know, the beauty of the tribal government is that you can buy them out
without having to convince the whole tribe. So that's another way to go about it.
Then there's the other option, which is the tribe says no, the tribal government says no.
And there's really nothing you can do about it, which happens. There are, however, cases where
the tribe says no, the tribal government say no, but the government will intervene saying sorry guys,
but we'll take away some sovereignty from you. We're not really going to make you like this,
make this choice because it's in the national interest we have to do this. And so we overroll you.
So for example, there have been cases both in the US and in Canada when
energy companies want to dam some rivers to create a hydroelectric basin.
And the tribe may oppose this, but it gets done anyway, because you know, more and more people
are, exist every day, more and more people flip the light switch on. There's more demand for
electricity that has to come from somewhere. So in a famous case involving the Cree in Canada,
there were a group of Cree who had been fairly successful at keeping a foot in both words.
Some of these guys that they had part of the year they would live in cities,
work in some cash jobs, but part of the year they would go back to their traditional hunting
grounds and they would live by hunting and gathering. And in this way, they have been doing
pretty well. The problem was that a company wanted to dam a river for electricity, right,
smack into the middle of some of their hunting grounds. These ended up flooding a lot of their
hunting grounds. This happened in the late 70s or early 80s. I can remember exactly. And so what
happened after that is that if you look at the statistics of the Cree involving these,
the rate of alcoholism went up, rate of poverty went up, rate of suicide went up,
because they no longer had the option of balancing between living in cities and their old life. Now
they were stuck in cities all the time, their old life was gone. And it's not that anybody in the
Canadian government was happy saying, yes, we screw these guys over. That was a great idea.
It's more like a sorry to tell you, but somebody's got to pay the price. Unfortunately,
was you guys, but this is just the way it is. These theme of conflict over land, you can even see
it in very recent times. In 2016 and in 2017, there has been this whole
drama surrounding the the cotax pipeline in North Dakota, the Standing Rock reservation.
Now you can find a lot of this stuff in the news. So I'm not going to repeat, you know,
the kind of thing that you can easily Google, but basically to just sketch the basics what happened
was. So this is a pipeline that was designed to carry oil, of course. And the thing about it,
that's a little tricky about the stories that originally the plan was supposed to,
the pipeline was to go through Bismarck, one of the biggest cities in North Dakota.
But as you may imagine, most people don't like to have pipelines right next to where they live,
because what happens to pipeline? Well, a lot of time they leak a lot of time there are
environmental problems, the result from it. So the inhabitants of Bismarck were some of the
wealthiest inhabitants of North Dakota decided, yeah, thanks but no thanks, we rather not have it.
So the pipeline was rerouted instead to go one mile outside the boundaries of the Standing Rock
reservation. Now, technically speaking, that land is not tribal land. So tough luck, you guys have
no standing on this. This is debated because this is part of a land that was guaranteed to the
tribes in an earlier treaty, but then it was taken away from them. So there's a bit of
tension regarding that status on whether this is a tribal land or not. So that's part of why the
tribe feel like, hey, you guys are cheating, you know, you are putting a pipeline in a situation
where if it breaks, it's going to affect our water supply, it's going to affect our people,
and you're just trying to cheat us on this. So there has been probably the most
activism involving an American Indian issue in modern times. The Dakota Access Pipeline
issue was sort of national news for quite a while, late 2016 and early 2017. And it was funding
some way to see how politicians reacted to this, because you went from Obama was still president
at the time and he clearly did really want to help the tribes because that would have put him
at odds with the oil companies. But at the same time, he didn't want to seem like a bad guy who
was going against the tribes. So he kind of deferred the situation as long as you're mainly
possible. And then when it became clear that trampo is going to be president, then, you know,
he said, okay, you know, I'm going to stop construction of the pipeline. So he would look like a good
guy in the eyes of people who are sympathetic to native issues, knowing full well that he's
ruling meant nothing since two months later, trampo would be in office and he would get to
make a decision on it. So it just kind of passed the hot potato forward. Candidates,
when you add tramp versus Clinton in the presidential election of 2016, Clinton, after being begged
for weeks to make a statement about this to support the opposition to the pipeline,
she made this statement that I invite you to Google it because it's hilarious. It's sort of the
prototype of why people don't trust politicians. Because basically Clinton went on and on for line
after line to say nothing, you know, she said, yeah, clearly we need to understand the grievances
of native peoples. And clearly we need to it's important to worry about the oil workers. And so
yeah, you know, she went, she spoke a lot to say nothing. She didn't take any stance on it,
on neither pro against because she didn't want to lose votes on either side. Tramp then even more
blunt on I mean, with Trump, there's the advantage of knowing where he stand that clearly did not
help the people opposing the who stood with the tribe at Standing Rock and against the Dakota
Access Pipeline because Trump he had invested in the pipeline. So he, you know, one of the first
things he did when he came into office was promptly authorized construction of the pipeline and continue
even to the point of saying stuff that was downright ludicrous because there was a moment there where
he stated, of course, I authorized it. Why wouldn't I? You know, is there even an issue here? I haven't
heard anybody complaining about the pipeline, which if you had only turned TV once in the previous
three months, you would have known that there was major movement against it. But you know, that's
the nature of the political game in United States. The fact of the matter is, in order to run for
office, you need money. And that's corporate money to a large degree. So the reality is that all
politicians, regardless of who they are, they are in bed with corporations who control them to a large
degree. Some people are more blunt about it. Some people are more obvious in these. Other people
try to look a little less compromised. Look being the keyword because the reality is to make it at
the level of the political game you have to be to serve some corporate interest to a high degree.
So that's bad news for native people who's going to come to land issues because usually the clash
is between some tribes not wanting the land to be developed and those corporations wanting to.
Needless to say, the government is always very clearly on one side. Another one in the list of
contemporary issues definitely affecting American Indians is the issue of racism. Now, if you look
at how American Indian history has changed in the last 100 years, well, for that matter, not just
American Indian, if you look at American history period, there has been tremendous changes when
it comes to ethnic relations. You know, in the early part of the 1900s, even up until, well,
probably 1950s, 1960s, there existed some openly discriminatory laws in the books.
Legal discrimination has been outlawed. Conditions have clearly improved in terms of the way, you
know, whereas racism was very much accepted earlier on, it tends to be more frowned upon today.
You had seen, like, you know, from 2000 days to 2016, black men becoming president of the United
States. You know, clearly there are signs to indicate that racism has lessened. Now, lessen
doesn't mean that it's gone. And it's one of those very tricky issues because whereas in the past,
it was pretty obvious, you know, you clearly knew where you stood because when you have,
when people were unashamed of being racist, they could be very upfront about it.
Today is a little trickier because even people who may very much be racist, usually say they are not.
It's one of those paradoxes where, I mean, I remember, I was in Larius, I remember being in
on a plane with a lady, one of these people really wanted to talk on a plane, and she started
talking to me saying, oh, I'm from Texas and everybody has this stereotype about Texas that
were racist, but we're not racist at all. We love black people, black people are great.
It's those Mexicans who are terrible. And I couldn't, I mean, I was trying not to laugh,
but I was thinking, you're really not here yourself. I mean, you're obviously racist, you're just
it's funny how you think you're not. Or once I was, I was looking for a house to rent in Long Beach,
in Long Beach, California, 2000 and something. And the first thing that the landlady said upon
seeing me was, ah, I'm so glad you're not black. And then she caught herself and she's like, no,
don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't like black people or anything. Black people are great.
It's just that if you have too many in the same neighborhood, they kind of lower the property value.
But no, no, I like them. I like them. It's just I wouldn't want one for my son in law. You know,
the more she opened her mouth trying to prove she wasn't racist, the worse it got.
And so that's one of the things today that we are in a cultural climate where, thankfully,
racism is no longer as accepted as he used to be. But that means that it's also harder to spot,
harder to figure out what is really racism and what isn't. And incidentally, in discussing racism,
it varies tremendously, depending on which part of the United States you live in, whether you live
in a city or a rural area, which state we're talking about, you know, it varies a lot. So it's
kind of hard to generalize, you know, you may have people who go through life in the United States
and hardly ever experience racism directly. You have other people who may run into stuff like
this a lot in their lives. But because you realize, you know, because again, racism today is not quite
as openly advertised as it used to be, there's more ambiguity surrounding it. You know, if somebody
is telling you, I hate you because of your skin color, well, that's pretty clear, right? But most
racism that exists today is not going to be that blunt, it's not going to be that obvious,
it's going to swap in different ways. And the problem with that is that it's not always clear
when it applies and when it doesn't. You know, sometimes people are discriminating against you
because of racial reasons. Sometimes people are discriminating against you because they're
having a bad day because you remind them of somebody they don't like because, you know,
10,000 other reasons may not really be racial. So here is the problem. It's not that racism is
gone. It's not. It's that is not always easy to tell. And the problem with it is that there are
people who then claim racism and I don't mean claim like they lie, they may even believe it, but they may
believe that racism apply even when it doesn't. And then because you always see or describe
racism, racism, even in cases where it may not apply, some people stop believing it. Some people
stop believing it even to the point where it turns into a boy cry wolf where, you know, they feel that
even in cases where objectively there is racism there, they will try to deny it by saying, oh,
and I've already with these things, we always hear about racism, whatever, get over it, you know.
So it is a different cultural context for sure than what exists in the United States in the early
1900s. As far as how it affects American Indians, clearly it still does, but much like the debate
about racism in American society as a whole in a different kind of way than he used to.
The story of James Weddle from the Yankton's who tribe is an interesting one because it's
precisely the kind of story that somebody would look at the case and see racism, somebody would
look at the same case and see no traces of racism. You know, just to give you a couple of the most
dramatic, I mean, the main issue at Weddle was he was in 1985, I believe he was convicted of
manslaughter. Even though we now know that he really didn't commit that, that he didn't kill that guy.
Never mind the fact that yeah, he was probably innocent. But aside for that,
what's interesting is that he got an eight year sentence for manslaughter, eight zero. Now typically
for manslaughter, you got like two to 15 years anywhere in there. So some native people would
look at that and say, huh, he's a native guy accused of killing a white guy. Of course he gets
an eight year sentence. Somebody else would say, no, you know, it's not about race. Maybe some other
reason. Maybe the judge thought he was a bad guy. Maybe whatever, you know, but or in another
occasion when Weddle ends up in South Dakota, stay penitentiary. And then he escapes along with five
other people. The other five are quote quickly, Weddle stays on the run for two years. Weddle's case
is going to end up on the TV show America's Most Wanted of veterinary ward for information for his
capture and all that stuff. What's interesting about it is that a few years earlier, a white guy
had escaped South Dakota State Penitentiary and that gone to promptly kill the witness who had
testified against him. So here you had a white guy who had escaped, who had killed the witness,
never ended up on America's Most Wanted. Weddle would turn out that he was innocent, escape,
doesn't really attack anybody, kill anybody, do anything like that. He ends up on America's Most
Wanted. Some native people look at that and say, well, because he's a native guy. Whereas the other
guy was a white guy. Now, is that true? Is that not who knows? It's hard to tell. I mean, it certainly
makes you think is like, why is it? But of course, because we can get into the mind of the America's
Most Wanted producer, we don't know. But those are the example of those cases that I'm referring to,
where we really sometimes don't know whether racism is at play or not. In any case, this is
interesting debate, but for the sake of simplicity, I'll cut it short.
Let's look at some other legal issues affecting native people in modern American culture. In 1978,
the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed. Again, that's Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978.
This is something that stops a practice. It was very common for impoverished Indian families to
be visited by social services, who would say that they are not fit to take care of their kids,
and so the kids would then be adopted out. The Indian Child Welfare Act requires social
services to find somebody willing to adopt first among the child's family, then within the tribe,
and then among other American Indians. Only when those options are exhausted,
non-native people can adopt a native kid. This was done to try to stop the outflow
of native kids out of native communities. Something else that stopped happening not by
legislation, but because the government begins to crack down on something that had always been
legal to the first place. There were lots of cases in the early 1900s, even mid-1900s,
of native women going to a hospital either to deliver a baby or to have some kind of surgery done,
and they would walk out of the hospital with the baby delivered or the surgery done,
but their tubes have been tied. Usually, they're without informed consent or with an informed
consent. There was some paper that was shoved in their face while they were heavily sedated.
They sign without knowing what they are signing, and before you know it, they get sterilized.
Why was that happening? Because there were plenty of doctors who didn't like them who thought
poor American, they are poor, they would add whatever racist idea they had about American
Indians. Too many of these people sterilized them. These happened more often than one would like to
think, but starting in the 1970s, both because of less racism, as well as because of an increase
of a crack down on these kind of things, you really don't see this type of stuff happening anymore.
So that's another interesting story. Here is a speaking of strange stories. Here is a crazy one
of modern stories involved in American Indians. There was a case in the 1990s involving members
of the Maca tribe from Washington state. Now for a long time, the Maca used to be hunters and
gatherers, and among the things they did was to hunt marine mammals, including whales.
Whale hunting though, stopped being a big part of their culture for quite a few decades.
But by the 90s, they had asked the federal government to make an exception. They said,
we understand that you have laws against whale hunting, but it's a big part of our culture.
We want to do it again. So give us an exception. Just allow us to hunt one way later.
The federal government granted this exception. These tremendously upset environmentalists to
fail that this was a way to get around existing laws protecting whales. There are several nations
around the world. For example, Japan, Iceland, Norway, very much like whale hunting, and are always
trying to find a way around international laws against it. So environmentalists are saying,
you guys are giving a huge gift to those kind of nations by doing this, because they will be able
to claim the same type of stuff. So what happened was really strange, because normally environmentalists
and American Indians tend to agree on a lot of issues, definitely not this time. Now I shouldn't
characterize it as American Indians, because this is one tribe. And even among that tribe is not
like everybody agreed. But what ended up happening is that the market then gets in their boats and
starts going around the ocean chasing a whale. There's an organization, an environmental
organization called Sea Shepherd, where the more direct action approach to environmental activism.
These guys promptly start chasing the market or chasing the whale. The coast guard starts
chasing Sea Shepherd or chasing the market or chasing the whale. So there's all this crazy drama on
the ocean. Eventually the backlash over this scene, after the market successfully killed one whale,
the following year the government decided to pose this exception, to stop this process, because
they feel they don't want to deal with the backlash from it. So these raises some interesting
question, because like for example, one thing that environmentalists were arguing was, look, if you
want to rebuild your traditions, we get it. That's a good idea. Nothing wrong with it. So you can
bring back the songs, so bring back the tradition of building the canoes, you can go out, see the
whale, but conditions have changed. You're not really going to be able to make a living by
whale hunting anymore anyway. And whereas in the past there were lots of whales today there aren't,
so how about you do all the other stuff, and then you just say, hello, Mr. Whale, and you turn
around and you go home, you don't need to kill the whale. Traditions need to adapt to the present
circumstances. Some of the Mac are saying, back off, this is our thing, just leave us alone,
we know how to do this stuff. So this was an interesting one, because it was very controversial
and was big in the news in the 1990s. On a different kind of topic, when it comes to American-India
religions, there are a couple of pieces of legislation that are very much affected
modern native religions. If you recall, in the late 1800s or early 1900s, most native religions
were outlawed. And it's not until 1978 that a piece of legislation will be passed called
the American-India Religious Freedom Act, which legalizes across the board the practice of native
traditions. And we cannot discriminate against a particular tribal religion, their own legal.
This is a huge step, I mean, it's crazy that it happens only in 1978, but it's clearly a positive
step. The problem is that it didn't address a few controversial issues, such as for example,
the issue of the use of Peyote by the Native American church that we discussed in another lesson.
So in 1994, a nearly identical piece of legislation is passed, something called the Native American
Free Exercise of Religion Act. This one is the same as the 78-1, except it's more specific.
It does legalize the use of Peyote for the Native American church, it does allow
American-India inmates to keep long hair in prison, where maybe prison rules don't allow it because
of the spiritual value associated with longer and native cultures. It does, you know, little
things like that, that are a little more specific than the 1978 act. Speaking of other laws that are
passed around this time affecting Native life, in 1990, a long-winded piece of legislation called
Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act is passed. For short, it's referred to as
NAGPRA, because Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act is kind of a mouthful.
So NAGPRA from 1990 is a piece of legislation that changes the dynamics between natives,
museums, archaeologists, and private collectors. Prior to this, archaeologists, museums, and private
collectors basically had a free reign when it came to Native artifacts. If you wanted to dig up
ancient burial grounds, if you wanted, you know, you could, there really weren't too many laws about
it. Natives were not so happy about it. And these puzzle archaeologists, because they were like,
hey, we're trying to help discover some of your history. Why wouldn't you want to? But, you know,
the way Native saw it is, yeah, how do you like it if I dig up your own, your grandma and put her
bones in my museum? So you need to ask permission, if nothing else. So NAGPRA forced archaeologists
to receive permission from the tribes involved. If forced museums to either return artifacts and
human remains, and some museums have a lot of human remains, you know, was estimated that the
Smithsonian Institute has the remains of some 19,000 American Indian individuals, so lots of bones.
You know, they have to return all this stuff or they lose all federal funding.
This applies also to private contractors. You know, if you're building a house and you dig the foundation
and you run into some kind of bones or human remains or even cultural artifacts from Native
people, you are supposed to stop everything, call an Agri-Expert expert, do a dig, figure out what's going on.
Clearly, a lot of contractors are going to take a quick look to the left and the right, and if
nobody's watching, they're just going to pour a bunch of concrete over it. But
theoretically speaking, NAGPRA protects Indian rights in this regard. Now, sometimes
things work out just fine. Sometimes archaeologists, you know, and by just fine, I mean, in a way that
everybody's happy with. An archaeologist will gain permission from the tribe. They will have
maybe 10 years to study the bones, and at the end of those 10 years, they have to return them
to be reburred. In some cases, tribes don't want the remains to be returned because they feel that
the spirits are mad. The spirits of the dead have been upset and now you deal with it.
In other cases, they are more than happy to receive them back and reburred them.
And in some cases, they flat out say, no, no more digs. You don't study this stuff. You leave it in
the ground where it was placed. That's where it's at.
Obviously, there are cases that are messy. Like, for example, if you find, if you accidentally
find remains from 5,000 years ago or 3,000 years ago or 7,000 years ago,
would you ask, you know, the local tribe that lives around there today, the odds are very slim
that they are the same people who are there 7,000 years before. So who should have a voice in this?
Well, you know, all of this stuff gets fairly complicated, fairly fast, but clearly,
Nagtritallist puts, gives American Indian peoples a seat at the table to have those kind of discussions.
Let's switch topic altogether. Let's look at something else. I mentioned,
I think he was in the previous lesson, how native peoples are only 1% of the total
population of the United States, which means that most people get their ideas
about natives from the media. And by media means most people don't, you know, they already read,
so mainly we're talking movies. Movies have a huge impact on the way natives are perceived,
since most Americans don't have day-to-day interactions with native Americans.
So the way which movies will represent native people will have a key influence
in how the average American will think and perceive native folks.
You can look at the development of how native peoples have been represented in movies over time.
There are exceptions to this pattern, but typically prior to the 1960s, the typical portrait of
native peoples in movies was never negative. They were the bad guys, they were the screaming
wild savages who come to try to kill good white folks. And, you know, there was no character
development, there was no attempt to understand their side. It's kind of like, you know, in the
fairy tales where the good night in shining armor has to kill the dragon who stole the princess,
nobody's wondering why is the dragon doing what he does. He's a dragon, he's a monster, he's weird,
what do you know? He's a good excuse for the hero to be heroic, that's all there is to it.
That's kind of how natives were represented in a lot of older movies. Incidentally, by the way,
on a secondary aspect, in many, many cases, native people were not played by native peoples.
You had the classic Hollywood habit of just grabbing white people, covering them in red paint,
and calling them natives. There's, you see that quite a bit.
Still happened today, by the way. There are still cases today where
Hollywood has this tendency to miscast people, where they cannot help themselves. And they think,
I mean, the rationale there is simple. They think that white people are still the majority of people
in the United States as of 2017. So if they,
Hollywood is afraid that if they cast a known white star, the number of people were going to want
to watch a movie or a TV series will decrease because they believe that people tend to watch
movies only if they can identify and they believe that people will identify only if it's somebody
from their same ethnic group. Personally, I think it's nuts. It just doesn't make any sense to me.
But I don't mean it's nuts. That is not true. I mean, to me, it doesn't make any sense. I don't feel
that way. But many people do. I'm not sure. You know, I'm not entirely. You have seen cases,
for example, like when Bruce Lee made it big, he only was accepted because he went to China,
to Hong Kong specifically, and made movies there became a super successful star. And only after
that, Hollywood was willing to have him as a lead star. But after Lee died, they believed in a
where, you know, they didn't want to give other Asian actors lead roles for the most part.
Same thing with natives, same things with, you know, the standard story involving natives,
almost unfeelingly, will have a white lead going to leave among natives. And then you can get the,
you can have, you can have both. You can still show native life, but at least you have the white
lead star that Hollywood feels good about. You see that a lot. I mean, even though post 1960s,
there were quite a few movies that took the native side more so where the representation was much
better to our native peoples. The huge period where native movies became a big hit was following
1990 when Dances with Walls won a Zillion Academy Awards. So then launched a period of the four
about a decade where native movies were hot, where Hollywood was willing to invest in native movies.
This is how Hollywood always works, by the way. They are never, you never want to be the first
to make a movie because everybody say, ah, we don't know if it's going to work, but then after a big
one is successful, then there's a period in which everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon for a
few years. You know, for the longest time, nobody was making movies about the ancient role, more
Greece, but then they did Gladiator and so he became a big trend for a few years. Nobody was
making movies about natives for a while. In 1990, Dances with Walls wins a lot of Academy Awards,
and so that starts a period where native movies become big. Dances with Walls, by the way,
is the exact story I told you. You know, you have a lead white star, you have Kevin Costner
going and sort of, you get to experience native culture through his eyes. There was another one,
made sure to withdraw after 1992. Really good movie, by the way. Last of the Moicans, and again,
you have a white lead star, you have Daniel Day-Lewis being the adopted son of a native family.
You see these beside native things, you know, think about movies like The Last Samurai,
it was the last Samurai Tom Cruise, really? Tom Cruise in Japan in the 1870s. That's the only
way of dealing with ethnic subjects. So in any case, Dances with Walls, Laster the Moicans were huge,
but not even close to the biggest movie effect in native people you can think of, which was the 1995
Pocahontas. Everybody watches Disney, so of course Pocahontas was a huge hit. And in many ways,
all of these movies, even though clearly they are way better than the way they used to be,
the way they represent native peoples, they introduced a whole other series of stereotypes.
They were, you know, in some way, as weird as it may sound, it's not that stereotypes disappear,
you know, you add negative stereotypes in the old movies and you have positive stereotypes in the
new movies. But the reality is that, well, let's stop that for a second. What does positive stereotypes
mean? You know, we're always talking about stereotypes as a bad thing, as a negative thing,
because you're taking some characteristic that may be true for a certain percentage of a population
and you're applying it to everybody. And we know that's stupid because reality is more complicated
than that. But why do people do it? Because it takes too much work to get to know everybody individually.
You really have to get to know you, you, you, and you, you know, how about, can I just plug you
into my mental file of what somebody from your nation or somebody with your skin color looks
like sound like what they believe what they are about? That's how stereotypes work, right? For the
most part, stereotypes tend to be negative. They're based on racism. There are also such things as
positive stereotypes, you know, like, all Asians must know math and no kung fu. Is it true?
No, of course not. But those are not bad things. Similarly, you know, me coming from Italy.
In the early 1900s, it wasn't really too cool being Italian in the United States. There was a lot
of racism. Eventually, somebody must have done good PRs because the stereotypes change and they
become much more positive. So yeah, you guys don't really work that hard by your big own family.
You could good food. You enjoy life. Plus I've watched Godfather 54 times. So I don't know
who's your cousin is. And I don't want to mess with your family. My old time favorite, of course,
is the whole Latin love or Italian stallion stereotype. Now does this apply to me? Who cares?
As long as other people think that they apply to me, that's all it counts. And the difference
is huge because if the stereotypes about your people are very negative, people will see you down the
street and, you know, cross the sidewalk the other way or get their hands on their gun. But if people
stereotypes about you are positive, you know, back to the Italian stallion stereotype, what do I get?
I get, you know, random dreamy smiles from women. I'm supposed to say, no way, your stereotype
in me. That's a bad thing. It's like, take it while you can. So there's a whole debate regarding
the kind of stereotypes that are introduced about native people in the 1990s because
there are two main stereotypes that emerge in the movies. The new image of native
simmovies is that they are super spiritual, having visions always having and in touch with nature,
the perfect environmentalist. If you look at movies like Pocahontas, if you look at Dances
With Wolves, those things show up big time. You know, every other movie features a mold in young
guy telling the white lead star, the eagle told me you would come, you know, I had a vision that
there's always that kind of story. So those two things, none of those two things are bad.
Spirituality is not bad, being in good to nature is not bad. But of course, it's it's taking
something that may be through about native cultures and blowing it completely out of proportion.
And you know, it can get annoying. You know, if the million person who tell you, oh, you're
native, let me tell you all about, I had this dream that I'm the reincarnation of crazy horse,
and it's just like, shut up already, you know. But there's a difference. And again, people
disagree. Some people think positive stereotypes are just as bad as negative stereotypes because
ultimately you want to treat people as individuals and stereotypes of any kinds are bad. And I mean,
don't have me wrong. Yeah, it's true. But that's in a very ideal world. The other way of looking
at it is that people are going to use stereotypes no matter what. But whereas negative stereotypes
lead people to want to shoot you positive stereotypes may lead to some misguided interest in you,
which is a lot better than people wanting to shoot you. So the argument that some people make is that,
you know, the little girl who may be born from racist parents, but she grew up playing with her
Pocahontas doll. She may not have the most accurate images of native culture, but she probably
will be less racist than her parents. So that's the argument for the positive stereotypes are not that
bad. Other movies from that period, Thunderheart is a really interesting one. And like most movies
that are about natives that are about the past, Thunderheart is about the 1970s, very much fictionalised
in the dynamics between the American Indian movement, the FBI and the DeQuelston regime.
Then there's one movie that was kind of at the tail end of the period of movies about natives,
as mock signals in 1998. This is a big one because it's the first major movie, you know, not little
independent, but a big major movie that was directed, written and ducked completely by native peoples.
So this was unlike all other movies that are outsiders looking at the culture from the outside,
this is an insider view of native culture. And there's also a contemporary story,
mixes drama with humor. But that was kind of the tail end. The last 20 years or so, since,
let's put it the way, since 1998, the end of the 90s, you really haven't seen a whole lot
in terms of native movies. You know, they still make stuff here and there.
And I'm sure it's gonna pick up again at some point, but hasn't happened yet.
Last thing, a couple of things I wanna mention still today for this lesson before we wrap.
Speaking of mock signals, the guy who wrote Smokseganal, the screenwriter,
is a man by the name of Sherman Alexey. Sherman Alexey is worth mentioning because he's the
only American Indian writer who has achieved a full mainstream status.
You know, there are a few American Indian writers who have had successful careers,
but primarily people buy their books because they wanna know about American Indians and they are
like the top representatives. Sherman Alexey is a guy who sells books even to people who couldn't
care less about American Indians. Just, he made it just because, I guess, enough people find this
writing really good to care, regardless of whether they are into natives or not. And Sherman Alexey
is a wild guy. I mean, he's, if you read this stuff, it's a mix of the heaviest drama and the
most hilarious humor in the weirdest kind of ways. I'll tell you a story that, I was told this story
by an American Indian professor. This isn't actually, it's a short story by Sherman Alexey
that I never read, so don't quote me on it. It's entirely possible that she may have tweaked some
things and embellished. It fits with Alexey's style, but I almost don't wanna know because
the story is too good. I don't wanna know if it's not exactly the truth, but the tale captured the
vibe of Sherman Alexey, for sure. Supposedly the story begins in a hospital where these native
families in deep grief because they're newborn baby, they have these little infantus, they say
some kind of terrible disease and will be dying soon. So the family is just heartbroken, they don't
know what to do, what to make of it, and the father in particular feels completely frustrated
and powerless, so he walks out, they're walking down the street in this age of grief. He just sees
signs flashing neon signs and babes in Toyland figure some kind of toy store. I don't know,
I guess I'll buy the key to gift, so maybe he smiles for to me. What else can I do? I don't know.
So he walks in, turns out he was a different kind of toy store, it's a sex store,
and he doesn't wanna look stupid like he walked in without knowing and the guy behind the
counter is beginning to look at him like, are you gonna buy something or are you wasting my time? So
feeling all embarrassed, the father just grabbed the first scene that defines weapons to be this
giant black deal, they're called chocolate thunder. Walks out, goes back to the hospital,
in the meantime his wife's family gathered there and they're all singing these songs to heal the
baby, to pray for the baby. The guy's wife is just working her fingers, pounding on the drum,
because nobody brought a drumstick, so the husband promptly whips up chocolate thunder,
hands it to the wife who uses it as a drumstick, and after all these the baby's miraculously
healed, and from that day on they hang chocolate thunder as a good luck charm on his crib.
Yeah, I know, it's, yeah, Sherman Alex is something else, so that gives you the vibe of what we are
talking about. No, really no other American Indian writer has achieved a level of fame,
Alexi has done it. Last but not least I should mention, since we're mentioning the art in
alright in movies, music wise there's a lot of, well there's a lot of traditional native music,
both in the powwow circuit and other formats where you can have access to the traditional
stuff, but there's also some modern musicians who are taking elements of traditional stuff and
mixing it with their own style. So for example, American Indian Movement member John Trudel used
to mix his reading his poetry with traditional music with rock and roll. You have other groups,
like there's a group called the tribe called Red who mixes electronic music with traditional stuff.
If you guys are interested just shoot me an email and I'll get you the links to some of this music,
but there's definitely some interesting experimentation down in that regard, so worth mentioning.
Okay, with that we are wrapped with lesson 9.
