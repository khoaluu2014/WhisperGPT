Welcome to audio lecture number 14. Today is going to be another one of those completely US history with zero Native American material present.
And like all of the ones that we do in this regard, these are big, skimming overview of US history. So we're going to touch on a lot of things.
Starting out with one of those events that you just can't avoid talking about, which is, you know, today we're mainly going to focus on the early times.
On the early 20th century, one of the big events of the early 20th century, not just for the United States, but for the whole world, is World War I, of course.
World War I can get highly complicated, and you know, for R6 we'll keep it to the bare bones of the whole thing and mainly focus on its legacy, on the consequences that World War I will have on, you know, the implications that you will have for US history.
To keep it simple, the one specific incident that will drive to the beginning of World War I is the murder of France Ferdinand, was there to the Austrian-Garian Empire.
You know, today there are different countries, there's Austria, there's Hungary, back then they were part of this one conglomerate known as the Austrian-Garian Empire.
For reasons that I'm not going to get into, because they get too complicated and specific to European politics and they really don't tell us we are narrative.
You know, I'm not going to go into the hole behind the scenes of what happened leading up to the murder of France Ferdinand, but basically to keep the story simple.
France Ferdinand was murdered by Serbian nationalists, where opposed to some of the policies of the Austrian-Garian Empire in the region.
So on the surface this sounds like a very regional dispute between two local powers in Europe.
Why would these lead to World War I?
Well, because back then, what many, many countries throughout Europe had done is devise and sign treaties of mutual alliance, which basically meant, you know, two countries would sign a treaty that said, if anybody attacks you, I'm bound to come to help you.
And if anybody attacks me, you are bound to help me.
This meant that many people felt that this would ensure peace, since nobody would want to start a fight.
They would, you know, not just a fight between the two nations, but everybody bring their friends to the fight.
Great in theory, until somebody actually does start a fight.
Because then what may seem like a regional issue quickly spiral out of control as everybody brings their bodies to the fight and you have many, many more nations involved.
So for example, Serbia had a deal with Russia that Russia would come to protect it, the Austrian-Garian Empire, the alliance with Germany.
In these, I mean, behind all these, there was also the story of the rivalry between France and England on one side and Germany of the other for control over Western Europe.
And this is basically how the alliance will be drawn. You're going to have Russia, France, England, and all of their allies on one side against Germany, the Austrian-Garian Empire and all of their allies on the other side.
The United States initially was perfectly happy to sit this one out.
You know, this is a problem for Europeans and some of their allies in the Middle East or other places. Why should we get involved?
And these made a lot of sense, particularly when people realized just how brutal World War I was.
You know, it had been a few years without a major war between Western powers.
And the technology had improved dramatically in the meantime, so nobody really had any idea of just the degree of carnage that new technologies could bring to a war.
And now they get to see it, and it's ugly. You know, World War I will be just trench warfare where these superpowers will porter troops in the front lines.
Troops will be facing each other, and in these long battles that sometime would go on for weeks or even months or in some cases even years where they stare at each other through the trenches, they shoot at each other, big cannons, poisonous gas, all sort of weapons that were kind of unknown before.
They will turn Europe into a bloodbath. Literally millions of people will die during the course of World War I.
So the United States is perfectly happy to sit out. The problem is that the United Kingdom began to start in pressure by starting an embargo against Germany, trying to prevent any commercial ship from bringing goods to sell to Germany.
The United States sold a lot of stuff in Germany, so they were kind of upset.
But the UK said, don't worry, in exchange for the fact that you're not going to be able to sell your goods in Germany, we are going to buy everything that you want to sell there.
So you're not going to lose out money.
Which again, great in theory, except for the fact that now Germany tried to do an embargo against the UK and attacking American ships heading there.
There were some famous cases, for example, the sinking of a ship known as the Lusitania led to the death of about 1200 people, including well over 100 Americans.
And that was because the Lusitania was not just a passenger ship, it was also carrying weapons that would help the UK during the war effort, so of course the Germans targeted it.
But overall, despite the fact that many Americans were upset over these interferences to their trade, they figured most Americans were anti-war.
They did not want to join a European war.
Udere Wilson was president at the time won re-election in 1916, promising that you would not join World War I.
World War I in Europe had been going on since 1914, so seemingly the US is out.
However, a couple of things contribute to change that.
For one, you see Germany increased the submarine warfare against the UK, sinking a whole bunch of American commercial ships.
And on top of it, one of the things that happened, one event that will drive the United States to war is that there would be a leaked note that was sent by the German Foreign Secretary to the German Ambassador in Mexico.
And in this letter, they indicated that the German Ambassador should work out a deal with the government of Mexico, so the Mexico would join German Alliance.
With the promise that if Germany won, then the US would attack, you know, if the war, let me rephrase that.
If the United States joined the war, then it would be Mexico's job to attack the United States, and if the German side won, then they would promise that they would give back to Mexico all the lands that the United States had taken from them during the Mexican-American War.
California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, plus a few other pieces of land, they would go back to Mexico.
When this became known that Germany was trying to strike a deal like this with Mexico, American public opinion basically changed overnight, and went from very much anti-war to being very much pro-war rather quickly.
Now, in preparation for the war effort, a couple of pieces of legislation were passed, the 1917 Espionage Act and the 1918 Sedition Act.
Now, both of those pieces of legislation severely limited freedom of speech.
In some cases, the Espionage Act would provide for prison times, for anybody obstructing recruitment for the army, so something even as metal was staged in an anti-war demonstration close to an army recruitment center could be qualified for a violation of the Espionage Act.
The 1919 Sedition Act basically said that any kind of harsh criticism to the government would be a violation of the Sedition Act.
These were obviously measures that would never be passed during peacetime, but during wartime, people are a little more willing to let them slide.
Because they are clearly a violation of civil liberties, however, during wartime, there's the feeling of like, well, yes, they are a violation, but it's worth it. We need to do it.
In many cases, these laws were used against groups that had nothing to do with the war.
People's unions were a primary target for these kind of legislations, bunch of other groups, any kind of political dissident anybody that the government didn't like could be targeted with these laws.
Now, in either case, the United States joined the war on the side of the UK, France and all their allies in 1917.
1917 is also the time when another major player, Russia, had to walk away from the war, so they basically tagged, you know, there's a tag there as Russia leaves and the United States get in.
Russia had to leave because the war effort had severely weakened the already weak Zar regime that existed in Russia.
They will be dealing with an internal revolution in 1917, which will eventually lead to the communist taking powers and the creation of the Soviet Union.
So they had to step out. The US got in.
But by the time the United States joined the war, it was just a matter of time before it would be a wrap.
By 1918, the whole thing was over, as Germany could no longer keep up the war effort.
All in all, some 52,000 Americans died in battle plus an almost equal number died because of the flu and other diseases during the time.
But this pales in comparison to the 9 million that in Russia, the 6 million in Germany, 5 in France, 2 for the UK, 2 for Italy.
World one was a carnage.
And while the British-French-American side won, it was still kind of a disaster for everybody in Europe because the war had really wrecked large parts of Europe.
But I promised you earlier that we would focus on the big implications of World one.
So let's look at one of them.
World one basically sets the stage for one of the biggest events of the 20th century that will involve the United States, which is the Cold War.
You know, had it not been for World War one, it's anybody's guess on whether communist in Russia would have been able to gain power.
Had communist non-gain power in Russia, then there may have not been a Soviet Union, there may have not been a Cold War, which as we're going to see will affect so much of the history of the 20th century.
So that's one big legacy.
Another big legacy will be associated with even more modern events with the war on terror.
You know, World War one led to the collapse of one of German allies, which was the Ottoman Empire, which was the last major Muslim Empire.
As a result of these collapse, these led to destabilization in the Middle East.
And many of the problems that we see associated with Middle Eastern politics today can be traced back to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
From the clashes over the Israeli-Palestinian questions to a bunch of other issues, go back to this.
And then of course with our World War one, and the humiliating piece treated Germany at the time, at the Treaty of Versailles, at the end of World War one, there would have been no room for a guy like Hitler to come to power in Germany.
So no Hitler, no Nazism, no Holocaust, no World War two.
So you can see how from the Cold War, World War two, possibly the war on terror, they can all be tied back to World War one.
So it's even toward one end that in 1918 its repercussions are still felt today, and they were definitely felt in U.S. history throughout the 20th century.
Now in the period immediately after the end of World War one, in 1920s, there were actually a fairly good period in American life.
The economy was booming. The United States got to sit at the winter stable after World War one without having had to pay the price as much as England or France had because the war was not fought on American soil.
So since we're not looking bad, the degree of prosperity had increased quite a bit. New technologies change American life in dramatic ways.
For example, the 1920s were the time when radio became an extremely popular form of media.
It's the time when cars will first become available to vast numbers of Americans as a Henry Ford and figured out a way to make the car manufacturing process cheaper by using an assembly line model.
So many Americans were now able to afford cars. The government invested heavily in building roads, so lots of changes were taking place.
The movie industry moved from New York to Hollywood, and the creation of the movie industry had a big impact on American culture.
I mean today probably Hollywood movies are the number one export.
On a cultural level is the one thing that most people around the world consume.
That is all American made.
Hollywood movies have a tremendously big impact on the culture of the entire world, let alone American culture.
The technology in the 20s also improved dramatically for movies.
You had in 1927 with a movie called the Jazz Singer, it was the first one in which the technology to add sound to movies was developed.
So you didn't just see black and white movies with no sound, now they were still black and white, but you could hear the voices and the music and all that stuff.
Hollywood was primarily a Jewish adventure.
Most of the major players in the Hollywood industry were Jewish people, the ones who created the studios, who ran the business, many were the writers, the producers and so on.
Now the popularity of Hollywood movies, oddly enough, created a bit of a backlash.
There were people who were upset with what they considered the low morals that Hollywood movies promoted.
Because as you guys well know, the twin pillars of popular entertainment are sex and violence.
Because they sell, because most people are attracted to them.
And so many people were more socially conservatives who were upset over the spreading of sex and violence through Hollywood movies.
In fear that these calls for a government crackdown on the studios would lead to an actual crackdown.
Hollywood preempted them by creating its own censorship board.
They started running their own programs to essentially censor themselves.
Why would they do it?
Well, because they didn't want the government to have the power to do it, they would rather run the process themselves.
So they started limiting, dramatically limiting the kind of, you know, any type of sexual content, any kind of nudity.
If you did show somebody breaking the law, they would have to be caught by the end of the movie.
They couldn't kind of glamorize gangsters, which had been during the 1920s, one of the main subjects of popular films.
And these are censorship codes, the last actually a few decades.
And this is going to be a big part of the industry itself.
Now another thing that's important to consider about the 1920s, these were a time of the political history.
The first sexual revolution in the United States.
More than ever before, people started having sex outside of marriage.
Still a smaller sexual revolution that will take place in the 1960s, but rather big nonetheless.
Much of it was tied to the popularity of cities.
As many people moved away from small rural towns across America and they congregated in cities.
In cities they found freedom, because unlike what happens in small towns where everybody goes seeps and, you know, if you do something that goes against typical community standards, everybody knows about it, they tell your family about it.
The cities are very anonymous, nobody know each other.
So people were able to get away with a lot more, and some people loved it because they saw this as an occasion to truly be free, and other people saw it as a sign of moral decay.
So people are social conservatives tended to hate urbanization, whereas people who were big on individual rights love urbanization.
Another thing that spread during the 1920s.
As part of these moral movements that were launched by social conservatives to crack down on what they perceived to be the immorality of the times, the movement for prohibition, prohibition of alcohol became successful in the 1920s.
The amendment, the 18th amendment, which is the one that will outlaw the production of alcohol in the US, will be passed and eventually implemented in 1920.
Now, consumption of alcohol was such a popular thing across the United States that any low interfering with this would inevitably create a big black market.
For people who, you know, if you outlaw something that's for which there's a lot of demand, well inevitably the demand will create a black market.
And that's something that criminal organizations of the time became incredibly wealthy as a result of this, because the profits generated by the illegal alcohol trade were so massive, the gangsters like Cal Capone could, they would make so much money that they would be able to just buy entire police departments and judges and politicians to basically look the other way.
They could still crack down on their competitors, but they would look the other way when it would come up to the business of the guys pain their salaries.
Now eventually became pretty obvious that prohibition was almost unenforceable, because no matter how many people you passed, there was way more than you could have passed.
So by 1933, the passing of the 21st Amendment repeals the 18th Amendment, the one that brings the prohibition experiment to an end.
The first and only time in US history that an amendment to the Constitution is repealed, and that's something that happened at this time.
Something else that was going on in the 20s, that characterized the early part of American culture in the 20th century, was a fairly high degree of racism.
In particular, the face of immigration had changed dramatically over the previous years.
There had been lots of immigrants coming over from countries that traditionally had not sent their people to the United States.
There were immigrants from southern Europe, there were immigrants from eastern Europe.
There were Jewish immigrants, there were no European immigrants.
There had been Chinese, Japanese people, and many of the older crowd of immigrants, many of the people were the camp from English speaking countries, protestant, non-American, and other people.
They were the store by the new immigrants.
Either people like the Irish who, yes, they were from northern Europe, they were Catholic, and their ways were very different from, or, traditionally, English ways.
Or they were the store because, technically, they were not from your northern Europe and very different from them.
There was a lot of anxiety over these new waves of immigration coming in.
And this anxiety seemed to find justification in something that was known as scientific racism.
Now, I put the quotation marks around scientific because, as it turns out, these studies were not really scientific.
They just gave an appearance of being scientific, but they were pseudoscience.
They were very poorly designed experiments.
They supposedly demonstrated that some ethnic groups are genetically superior to others in terms of intelligence.
Now, we know today that most of those experiments were flawed and that, basically, a lot of the scientists found the results they wanted to find, but the sign in the experiments to live there, which is already not good science.
But at this time, many people bought in these ideas.
So they felt that it was their duty to pass laws, to prevent these stupid people from other countries, to bring their low level IQ to the United States and water down the average level of intelligence.
So there were immigration laws, for example, such as the National Origin Act of 1924.
They were passed to try to limit the number of immigrants coming from these other countries, specifically the National Origin Act of 1924, allowed for, it gave a quota to each nation around the world.
And each nation could only send to the United States for legal immigration 2% of the population that lived in the US in 1890.
Meaning if there were 100,000 people from, I don't know, Japan in the US in the 1890s, then 2,000 of those could legally migrate to the US every year.
Now, why are they basing it on the 1890 census?
Well, because the people who push for this law like the ethnic makeup of the US much better in 1890 than they did in 1924.
So they wanted more of those immigrants from those countries they liked, primarily Northern European Protestants, and less from those immigrants of countries they didn't like, which is basically everyone else.
Interesting enough at that time, even the definition of who was considered white was different than it would be later on.
Jewish people were not considered white, no matter their skin color, because of religious and cultural reasons.
The Irish, which, I mean, it's kind of a joke, because if you see anybody with Irish, it's like white as not right, you cannot get any lighter skin than that.
But the Irish were not considered white.
Italians were not considered white. A bunch of groups that were later be considered white were not, showing that the idea of whiteness was not just a racial thing, it was more of an ideological thing.
So in this climate of fairly intense racism, the Klukook's clan was created for a second time. Specifically in 1915, there was a movie that was released called Burt of a Nation, a very much glorified the old time KKK.
And this led to a recreation of the KKK that had been destroyed during the period of reconstruction, but is now brought to life for a second time.
In addition to some fairly extreme racism, the KKK stood for very strict Christian fundamentalism, was against Burt control, was against the teaching of evolution in school, and very much set itself up as the defender of traditional rural American values against big city morality.
The KKK became so popular that at the height of its popularity counted about 5 million members, and these are just active members, not even people who sympathize with their ideas.
Some scholars have even suggested that President Harding, who was president between 1920 and 23, had become a KKK member, which if true would give a whole new meaning to the idea of the white house, other people say that's not the case.
There's arguments about it, but there's definitely no argument over the fact that they were supreme court justices, senators, congressmen, who had joined the KKK, because it was very much a mainstream organization, at least during the 1920s.
Associated with this is also the growth of Christian fundamentalism.
Christianity, like any religion, leads itself to many different interpretations, they were very mellow approaches to Christianity and very strict ones.
Christian fundamentalism that gets his name from a series of books published between 1910 and 1915, called the Fundamentals,
preached a very tough approach to Christianity.
It argued that the Bible is absolutely true in every instance, there are no metaphors in the Bible, everything is literally true, it argued for extremely strict morality, it,
and the popularity of Christian fundamentalism led to some changes in laws, for example, many southerners started out low in the teaching of evolution in school, because it seemed to clash with the literal reading of the Bible regarding the origin of the spaces.
So much so, that you will see, there will be famous instances such as the scopes trial in 1925, when a biology teacher by the name of John Scopes broke a Tennessee state law outowing the teaching of evolution in school.
Now he intentionally did it, so there was never an argument about whether he was guilty or not, of course he was guilty.
But the trial was more about the legitimacy of the law itself, any pit, a more urban, scientifically minded version of the United States against the moral, rural, Christian fundamentalist version of the United States.
And while Scopes was convicted, you know, nothing big happened to him, it was kind of a slap on the wrist, the big deal was that Christian fundamentalism was portrayed as being sort of backward and ignorant in much of the press,
and it sort of drove it underground, at least for a while. Many people predicted that it would sort of fade away in light of growing reliance on scientific knowledge.
That turns out not to be correct for a variety of reasons that may be a bit too complicated to address now, but this sets up the stage for this clash between these two different souls in American society, the more scientifically minded urban America versus the more Christian fundamentalist rural America.
Now one more event that took place at the end of the 1920s, leading into the 30s, will be the Great Depression.
The economy of the 20s kept growing and growing and growing, but a lot of it was, this growth was artificial.
Many of the stocks and bonds that were sold at the time, their values were inflated by predictions about where the values of the stocks would be rather than where it actually was.
It's kind of like a bubble. So, you know, there was this expectation of constantly rising prices, rising production and rising profits.
But of course, anybody to look at the economy realizes that that's never how it works. It's not a straight line where everything is always getting there's improvement.
There are times when the economy slows down. And when it did, it led to this burst of this stock bubble.
So in 1929, one of the events that kind of led to the beginning of the Great Depression was the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
The stock mark crashed and people who thought that they had saved for retirement suddenly find out that they have no money left from one day to the next.
Unemployment begins to climb. You know, by 1930 will be considered a 9% by 1931, 18% by 1933, 25%.
Now 25% unemployment is pretty catastrophic because, you know, that just 25% of people who have no job whatsoever, not even counting the ones that have jobs that don't quite adapt to having enough to live on.
This was the Great Depression. This was the situation where vast numbers of Americans were dirt poor, add next to nothing.
This idea of, you know, pull yourself up by your bootstraps eventually is going to work out. Okay, sure, maybe eventually, but people were starving right then.
And eventually was not a very rich ring concept. So the fact that the government endorsed this kind of hands on approach to the economy.
It had been popular as long as the economy was going well in the 20s was not so popular now that the economy was in this array at the end of the 20s and into the early 30s.
So not surprisingly, the Republican presidents had been in power from 1920 through 1932. There was a series of three of them.
We'll lose out to Franklin Don Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate who will win the 1932 election.
Now by this point, Democrat and Republican begin to mean what they still mean today. You know, their political philosophies are consistent.
Democrats were for bigger government in terms of handling the economy, Republicans less so.
And during time of crisis, when people wanted a solution now, not in five or ten years when the market would write itself, that's when decided to switch and voted for Franklin Don Roosevelt.
Now, in terms of FDR, Franklin Don Roosevelt, what his most famous for is what will become known as the New Deal.
The New Deal is not a single piece of legislation. It's a collection of a bunch of ideas designed to bring back the economy.
But with all these ideas, I mean, common. You know, whether we're talking about things like the civilian conservation corps in which the government hired people to build roads,
run national parks, things like that, or the federal emergency or a leaf administration, which was kind of a form of welfare,
or even things like the creation of social security in the 1930s, setting aside some money so that people will have it for retirement or unemployment insurance or things like this.
All these laws and many others setting common one idea, the idea that the government should help regulate the economy in order to avoid the ups and downs of the markets that could leave people on the street starving as it did during the Great Depression.
So, the FDR approach to handling the Great Depression was the New Deal, was using government power to tackle these problems.
And he did it in many ways, and apparently he was popular enough that he ends up getting elected four times, 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944,
which today would sound illegal because there's a two-term limit. Back then, there wasn't. You could run as many times as you want.
FDR would probably still president today, had enough died in 1945, while enough. His people kept electing him over and over again.
Now, not everybody was a fan. For example, the Supreme Court in many cases tried to stop some of the reforms that he wanted to push, arguing that they were unconstitutional.
There was a bit of a clash between FDR and the Supreme Court during this time. There was also a clash between Republicans who accused FDR of being a socialist,
and people on the left to accuse FDR of being not enough of a socialist, and not getting the government involved enough.
So, he was kind of in a weird position, getting criticized by both the left and the right. But clearly he had enough support to win many, many different elections back to back.
And, you know, people of course, as you may imagine, argue about his legacy on whether the new deal is truly what led to the end of the Great Depression or not,
but regardless he left an incredibly powerful mark on the history of the United States.
Now, with that, I cover a ton of important events in the early part of the 20th century in US history.
Again, this is barely a scheme in overview, but I wanted to touch on those events because they are part, you know, any educated person who has at least a passing knowledge of US history should at least vaguely know about them.
So, that's what we did in this particular lecture.
With this, it's a wrap, and I wish you a very good day.
