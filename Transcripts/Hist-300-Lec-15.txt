Hello and welcome to our very last lecture. Today it's gonna be a bit of a crazy one because as you have figured out by now, this is not just a standard, super rush review of USC story discourse, you know it's a thematic approach we focus primarily on the relationship with between the United States and Native American peoples. However, here and there we do have lectures that cover more generic themes that have nothing to do with native peoples.
This is gonna be one of them and it's gonna be a slightly complicated one because we're covering a whole bunch of events from the middle to the latter part of the 20th and even the beginning of the 21st century.
So inevitably, covering so much material in so little time means that we are gonna be doing sort of a bird eye view of the topic.
We're gonna skip a whole bunch of topics, we're not gonna even try to be comprehensive about everything that happened in US history in the latter part of the 20th century.
We're just gonna focus on a few big ones and jump from one to the next.
So here we go and even with these big ones, we are going to be giving a very bare bones version of the story because something like you know first topic that we're gonna jump into is World War II.
World War II alone, one could spend a semester covering it, we are gonna be doing it in minutes.
So of course that's a different kind of setup.
In any case, without further ado, let's jump into this.
Okay, so speaking of World War II, the United States will be involved in two different wars in World War II.
There will be the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific, the war in the Pacific against Japan, the war in Europe against primarily Germany and Italy on the side.
So the way to give at least a very, very basic sense of what created the war in the Pacific,
if you really wanna understand it, you have to go back almost 100 years before World War II.
At a time when Japan had been isolated for well over two centuries, about two and a half centuries,
they had push a policy of avoiding trade or any kind of intercourse with the West because they had seen out so many times trade and missionaries were only step one on Western powers eventually colonizing Asian nations.
So in an effort to avoid the destiny, they had closed down trade with the West, they prevented missionaries from doing their work in Japan,
and they had been successful in their regard.
They were one of the very, very few Asian nations to remain independent of European colonization as a result of this.
But by the 1850s, they had kind of lag behind in terms of technological innovation.
So when in 1853, the United States sent their navy to Japan, saying, we want to trade with you,
and the Japanese did not want to trade with the Americans, they really had no option because once the Americans threatened them with their naval powers,
once the admirreling charge by the name of Paris said, look, I have big, huge cannons here on these ships,
and unless you guys let us trade, we are going to have a problem.
Well, Japan had to capitulate, they had to give in to American demands because their military technology could no longer keep up with the West by the 1850s.
These are a dramatic impact on Japanese history because it forced them to modernize very quickly.
They tried to figure out how to stay competitive with the West when they realized they were clearly lagging behind by this point.
So in the span of a few decades, they modernized their nation at extremely fast rate in terms of technology, in terms of forms of government and all of that.
But basically the heritage of these events was that Japan was affected in two different ways.
On one level, they had become a modern power.
In the early 1900s, they defeated the Russia in a war and it was the first time that an Asian nation beat a Western one in warfare.
And also there was this sense of wounded national trade and desire for revenge, which very much characterized the nationalism that will fuel Japanese society in the early 1900s.
One of the things that they realized is that in order to stay as powerful as Western nations, once in the Western nations did, it colonized other nations.
So Japan set about building their own little empire by taking over lands in other parts of Asia, either from other Asian peoples or from European powers who had colonized there.
So that's as far as Japan goes.
Already in the mid-1930s, they were busy trying to expand into other parts of Asia in 1937.
They invaded China and all of these were not something the Western powers were particularly thrilled with.
So keep that one in mind.
Now let's switch gears to the European side of the war.
In some way there's a similar story there because if you recall from what we had said about World War I, the end of World War I had put Germany in a weird position.
Germany had been forced to sign a peace treaty that was very humiliating.
It was also very tough to live up to because they had to pay very heavily for war reparations to both France and England.
So the German economy was in shambles and the general opposition to the Treaty of Versailles among Germans.
I kind of opened the door for people like Hitler to come in and kind of use their demagogie being like,
I'm going to be the strongman who's going to defend you against the abuses of the Treaty of Versailles.
I'm going to be the one who's going to bring Germany back to its former glory.
And this was a kind of rhetoric that was very appealing to the Germans of the time.
So the same sense of wounded hyper-nationalism and the desire of revenge that existed in Japan also existed in Germany.
And Hitler began pushing the envelope. He started breaking in minor ways the Treaty of Versailles.
He began in the 1930s to expand by invading part of Czechoslovakia.
And both France and the UK remember way too well how harsh Warlord I had been.
And they were no hurry to start another war.
So they were more or less appeasing Hitler by not directly challenging him.
And you know, he took this as encouragement. He figured these guys are too weak.
They are not going to stand up to us. So I'm going to keep going forward.
And before you know it started invading more and more parts of Europe ended up even invading France itself.
And basically it made it clear to everyone involved in Western Europe that the war was back on.
That what they thought was over in Warlord I had only been a break in a war.
But now Germany was trying to get back what they had lost and a lot more.
Now as this was going on Germany basically ended up conquering all of Western Europe except for the UK
which by virtue of being an island were not vulnerable to a German landing vision.
Spain which had a fascist regime which was technically neutral but ideologically in line with Hitler.
Italy which also had a fascist regime that was directly allied with Germany.
And also they signed a deal with Japan. So there was this alliance between Germany, Italy and Japan to support one another.
But basically Western Europe other than the UK was all entirely in Hitler's hands.
The only thing in Europe that really wasn't in Hitler's hands was Russia and all the nations associated with what becomes the Soviet Union.
Because communist and Nazis didn't like each other a whole lot. They were rivals.
They do at some point make a pact to work with each other.
In fact the Hitler will promptly break. So those two will be rivals.
But on the Pacific front the one event that will draw the United States into the war will be the attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.
In December of 1941.
What happened was that President Roosevelt had frozen Japanese assets in the United States.
All the money that Japan had invested in US had been frozen.
And he also started an oil embargo against Japan to try to limit their imperialistic policy in Asia.
Japan saw this as an existential threat because if they couldn't get oil they would just quickly collapse.
So they decided to go forward with direct attack on the United States.
And they did so at Pearl Harbor the attack was partially successful.
They destroyed the good chunks of American ships but not nearly as many as they had hoped for.
So the second this happened, US was officially involved with the war.
So American participation in the war will last from 1941 through 1945.
It's not going to go really well initially.
There's definitely going to be struggles early on.
But 1942 is still at a fear. The United States will lose possession of the Philippines that they had control over.
But by 1943 a combination of the Red Army and Europe being able to beat back the Nazi advances
and begin to push back the Germans back to order homeland.
The alliance between the UK and the US beginning to win battles in North Africa against both the fascist and Nazi armies.
Slowly making their way into Italy.

in Italy. Also thanks to some of the Italian partisans as well as in France.
The resistance in some of these countries there were plenty of people who opposed their own governments
who were allied with the Germans.
And the combination of the re-afiting at a street level,
the enormous importance of the American army winning battles against the Italian and the German armies
led slowly but surely to the collapse of German power in Europe.
One after another all the nations that they had conquered are beginning to be liberated.
On June 6, 1944 what becomes known as D-Day.
D-Day was the invasion of Normandy.
The northern portion of France looking across the English channel.
Americans, British-Canadian troops landed in Normandy in order to set up an invasion of what will lead very quickly to the freedom of France.
Kekeau de Nades is out of France and while the Russians are coming in from the East,
Americans and British are coming in from the West.
And before you know it in less than a year and it's actually within by May 8, 1945
the Germans control nothing except Berlin itself.
Hitler will shoot himself ending his career with suicide and Nazi Germany has lost.
And at the same time similar story of the happened with Japan, they start losing all of the countries that they have been conquering in the early portion of the war.
But the problem is that even after they have been beaten in all these other countries they were not ready to surrender.
President Roosevelt had died in office in the meantime, so the new president and President Truman has a decision to make.
Do I launch a land invasion of Japan which will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands both Japanese as well as American troops?
Or do I use this new technology that has just become available for the United States which is the nuclear bomb?
This as you may imagine is not exactly an easy decision to make.
Whichever path it chooses, Truman will send hundreds of thousands to their death.
In this case it is a site to save on American lives and use the nuclear bomb.
So the US in 1945 will drop two nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to large Japanese cities leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.
This will bring Japan to its knees and eventually to its surrender, bringing in World War II to an end.
Now speaking of World War II something else which I am sure you guys are aware of but worth repeating,
one thing that became clear after the end of the war was that Nazi Germany had been busy trying to wipe out the Jewish population of Europe in what became known as the Holocaust.
Some historians estimate that 6 million Jewish people were killed in concentration camps throughout Europe.
Besides Jewish people there were also plenty of political opponents, homosexuals, gypsies, you know, various groups that the Nazis hated but primarily with Jewish people.
In either case these dead camps were the result of a long legacy of anti-Semitism in Europe.
This was not just Hitler going crazy in the 1940s, it was while his policies were clearly more extreme and genocidal in nature.
They can be tied directly to the tradition of anti-Semitism that had been alive and well in Europe for several hundreds years.
So that's some, you know, sometimes it's a little too easy to sweep it under the rug as something that just an evil guy like Hitler did.
Well the reality is a little more complex than that, because while Hitler was certainly number one person responsible for it,
none of that would have been possible, and there not been some strong anti-Semitism in Europe to begin with.
So that's war to keep in mind.
Now the end of World War II doesn't mean that it's the end of tension, because almost immediately a new conflict arises.
Specifically this conflict between former allies, you know, we have one side, we have the United States, and on the other side we have the Soviet Union.
Both of them had contributed to defeat Nazi-Germanism and had been a lie in this effort.
But now that the war is over, they remember that one is very capitalist, one is communist and they don't like each other very much.
So almost immediately, at the end of World War II we see the beginning of the Cold War.
Now the reason why the war is referred to as a Cold War is because the Soviet Union and the United States will not be able to attack one another directly.
For the simple reason that very quickly the Soviet Union will also develop nuclear weapons, and so in what's known as the idea of mutually assured destruction,
neither side could afford to attack the other, because if you start dropping nuclear weapons on them, they will quickly retaliate with nuclear weapons and they could, both nations could wipe each other out.
So what's gonna happen for the next few decades is that both sides are going to try to extend their sphere of influence throughout the war.
Through a series of proxy wars where the Soviets will support communist regimes around the world and the spread of communism,
Americans will support their allies against communism, and that's how they will basically play this political game for the next several decades,
in a way that will affect the entire world, not just those two nations.
The Truman Doctrine itself was known as the Truman Doctrine, the Truman argued that he was the US responsibility to intervene,
to stop the expansion of communism anywhere in the world, which is basically the essence of the Cold War.
There were a couple of things that triggered the Cold War, for example, what the United States did in Europe was known as Marshall Plan.
Marshall Plan involved putting a lot of money into the reconstruction of Germany, because they wanted to avoid making the same mistake as made during World War I,
which was to leave a nation in ruins, which would then create, you know, open the door to a demagogue to come in and try to rally up and all of that.
They wanted to rebuild Germany in such a way that there would be no reasons for fighting in the future, because the people there would be doing well.
This put in a lot of money into Western Germany, which was the area controlled by the United States, angered the Soviet Union,
they saw it as a direct challenge, you know, the US trying to make themselves look good, saying,
hey, look, the areas that we control, the quality of life can go up so much more compared to the areas controlled by the Soviets.
So in what's known as Berlin crisis, Stalin was the communist dictator in Russia, built a wall, and essentially separated,
preventing any traffic from East Berlin to West Berlin, from the areas controlled by the Soviets to the area controlled by the Americans.
And these, in many ways, the symbol of the Cold War. There's that separation. There's a line thrown in the sand between one area of influence and the other.
And the rest of the world will have to choose which side they're on.
Now, this climate of the Cold War created a lot of fear and paranoia throughout American society, because there was this fear of the spreading of communism, not just in other countries, but even within the US.
You know, especially there was a case from 1953, the Rosenberg trial, where these married couple, the Rosenbergs, were found guilty of selling US military secrets to the Soviet Union.
And they were eventually executed.
So the fear was there are secret communists in the United States who are working for the other side.
One guy who built a big reputation on this idea of fighting communism at home, who was a man by the name of Joe McCarthy.
He was a Republican Senator from Wisconsin who kept kind of using the fear of communism to build this popularity.
He argued that he had this long list of known communists who were working for the government, and only he would be able to stop them.
And so initially he gained a lot of popularity as a result of this.
But eventually you can only say you have a list in your hands before somebody asks you to prove it.
And as it turns out, he had largely, I wouldn't say made up because certainly they were a few people, but he was not nearly as extensive as he had claimed.
So the Senate will eventually censor his activities basically as fear-mongering because the reality was very different from what he had been claiming.
This climate of fear will be the story of the Cold War because when you look at what communism had done worldwide, it was terrible.
There's no way to spin that.
The human rights record of communist regimes is just atrocious.
At the same time, the problem of the Cold War will be that people are not going to be given too many choices.
The approach that especially will take place in the US is either on the side of a super conservative interpretation of American politics or you are with the communist.
And clearly the majority of people were neither one or the other.
They fell somewhere in between.
But that choice did not exist in the Cold War. It is a pick one side.
Actual real communist in the United States were probably a tiny minority.
But once you claim that anybody who doesn't embrace a conservative view of American politics as a communist, suddenly you turn what was a very real but small problem, at least in the US, into something that targets maybe 50% of the population or more.
To give you guys an example, there were quotes.
This one is by the Chairman of the Han American Activities Committee, which was a committee designed to try to find out about communists working in Hollywood, trying to brainwash American people through their propaganda.
Somebody asked the Chairman, how can you tell if somebody is a communist?
And the Chairman had replied, if someone insists that there is discrimination against Negroes in this country,
or that there is an inequality of wealth, there is every reason to believe that person is a communist.
Which is kind of a joke, because basically if somebody is saying there is racial discrimination, of course there is racial discrimination.
This is the 1940s, 1950s.
Segregation is the law of the land is part of the South.
But if you say it, then it means you are a communist.
Or if you say there is inequality of wealth, again, of course there is inequality of wealth.
Somebody can argue that's natural and it's fine, but when you have homeless people and billionaires,
saying there is inequality of wealth is like saying the sun is outside, it's not even up for debate.
But if you say that, that means you are a communist.
So you can see how the legitimate fear of communism led to places that were not the healthy.
And this will affect a lot of the culture of the next few decades.
The US will actually get into an open war with communism in the...
By 1950, after China had become communist and they started spreading into Korea,
Koreans were against communism, asked for American help, whereas Koreans pro-communism had Chinese help,
and the two nations went at it for the next three years between 1950 and 1953.
Neither side could conclusively beat the other, which is why today you have two Koreas,
a North Korea that was more allied with China and the South Korea more tied to the United States.
The main general was being charged of World War II in the Pacific Dwight...
Sorry, Dwight Eisenhower was the general in charge of the war in Europe.
And he became president by 1952, whereas the other main general, Dagaz Makartor, kind of lost his luster
because of a clash with President Truman during the Korean War.
So basically, the Cold War will dominate the discussion of American politics for the next few decades.
Now again, as I mentioned, we are skimming.
So we are just going to be treating the next few decades as we are a bird flying over them
and quickly taking notice of a few big events.
We are not even going to get into all the technological changes, how they change everything.
You know, things like the introduction of television in the 1940s, how they affect American culture,
the way American culture changes, the popularity of things like rock and rolls, things like that.
I'm just going to briefly mention the 1960 election when John Fitzgerald Kennedy beats Richard Nixon,
largely thanks to the introduction of television, because Kennedy was a much more good-looking
and charismatic guy, at least on TV, the Nixon was.
So the presidential debates were for the first time broadcasted on TV at this time.
Tremendously helped Kennedy in a very close vote election.
So he won the election.
During his tenure in office, rather for tenure in office,
considering that he will be assassinated in 1963, but during that period he had an office,
that's when the Cold War became extremely hot.
Something known as the Cuban Missile Crisis was probably the closest that the Soviet Union
and the United States got to an open warfare.
What had happened was that after the nation of Cuba turned communist,
the United States had helped Cuban dissidents against communism trying to take back the island.
When this effort had failed, Castro had asked the Soviet Union for missiles to defend himself
against what he perceived to be American attacks.
Americans had told the Soviet Union, if you give Castro's missiles and uses them against American cities,
we're going to bomb you.
So here you have two nuclear powers threatening each other with destruction.
And it took a lot of delicate maneuvering to eventually find a compromise to step back
with the US promising they will not invade Cuba, the Soviet Union then saying,
okay, we're not going to give missiles to Castro and eventually defusing the situation.
Another thing that's very important in American history of this time is the Civil Rights Movement.
You know, by the 1950s, the system of segregation that had existed in the South with one set of schools,
drinking fountain, opportunities for white people and a very different one for black people
have been largely tolerated by the American government.
But the Cold War is making it harder and harder to do so because as both the United States and the Soviet Union
are trying to convince the rest of the world that they are the good guys.
Racial inequality in the US is not helping the American case to argue we are the good guys
because all the Soviet Union had to do was point to extreme discrimination in parts of US
show this evidence to many countries around the world that are populated by not white people
and essentially tell them why would you want to join the US?
Don't you see how racist they are?
Don't you see how they treat people with your skin color?
Why would you join us?
We are the good guys.
Now, of course, the Soviet Union was not the good guys, but you know,
they had a point about the racism still exists in American culture.
So slowly but surely segregation was under attack and the government was more willing that they may have been
otherwise because they wanted to take a propaganda weapon away from the Soviet Union.
In 1954, the Brown vs. Board of Education decision made segregation in school illegal.
This was something that was fought to the nail in the south.
And shortly thereafter, toward the middle of the 1950s, is when the civil rights proper will begin to try to tear down the system of segregation.
Starting with events like the Montgomery Bus Boycott, you continue with things like the Freedom Right, the Cities,
these were, again, without getting into the specifics, the big picture is to a mix of nonviolent demonstrations, economic boycotts,
and just flat out trying to embarrass the government into intervening and not just pretending to look the other way.
Civil rights activists upheld these nonviolent tactics to create change.
And they were very successful.
I mean, again, the whole story of the civil rights movement is long and complicated and there are victories and defeats,
but the overall trajectory is that in the span of a decade or so, the civil rights movement was able to finish the job, the reconstruction back in the 1870s
and promised they would do, but never quite got around to finishing.
So we see these happening throughout the latter part of the 50s into the early 1960s.
Now, just as the civil rights movement was winding down, largely because it was victorious and was able to bring down segregation in the mid-1960s,
something else happened to increase the level of internal tension in the United States.
Specifically, in 1965, the United States became more directly involved in Vietnam.
They had been involved in Vietnam for a while, meaning after Vietnam had freed itself from French domination,
the country was sort of split between communists who wanted to turn the whole country communist and the people who were not.
So there was a split between North Vietnam, there was communist and South Vietnam, that was not.
Needless to say, the United States supported the South Vietnam.
In 1965, as a result of something known as the Tonkin incident, when American ships reported being shot at by the North Vietnamese
and there's a whole controversy about it that has led to lots of conspiracy theories because it looks like that incident,
there's debate about whether it did or did not take place.
By any case, in 1965, after years of being somewhat involved, the US will get directly involved by entering with boots on the ground and starting war in Vietnam,
on the side of the South Vietnamese against the North Vietnamese.
The Vietnam War will turn out to be the most unpopular ever in the US history.
And it's not a coincidence that it is the most unpopular.
It happens largely because of television, because unlike previous wars, where it was a little easier for the government to run their propaganda about the goals of the war and what was happening on the ground,
this was getting a lot harder when TV reporters with a camera could show footage that didn't quite fit the government version of what was going on.
So while initially there was a decent amount of support for the Vietnam War, the longer the war continued, the more there was a position to it,
starting out in college campuses primarily among students who started building the anti-war movement.
And students had more than one reason, not only an ideological opposition to the war, but because at this time there was still a draft.
You know, any American male could be drafted into the army.
Many people were so opposed to this that they refused to serve, which of course is a crime, so that means they would either be jailed for it or they would go on the run.
These are never happened on such a scale in US history, and again a lot of it is because the standard government rhetoric of we are the good guys and this is why we're doing it was becoming a little harder to swallow when you saw certain images that did not seem to conform to this very black and white view of things in Vietnam.
In some way the Vietnam War contributed to the creation of a culture in the 1960s, there was very much built on questioning authority.
And this questioning authority was facilitated by technology, the fact that we simply knew a lot more about what was happening than we did before.
Growing opposition to the Vietnam War continued through the latter part of the 60s, the early 70s, even people like Martin Luther King came out against the Vietnam War, and political conflicts in American society became progressively more intense.
And you know, the Vietnam War was definitely one of the key factors in this regard, but it was by no means the only one.
So the culture of the 60s was very different from previous American culture.
This was a time of major sexual revolution where growing numbers of people started having sex outside of marriage, people experimenting greater numbers with psychedelic drugs, people opposing a war in a way that had never happened in US history to this degree.
You know, this whole idea of questioning authority was a dominant theme of the 1960s in US.
But just as this concept was very popular among the large numbers of people, it was also unpopular with large numbers of people.
So in what is known as the conservative backlash, people who held more culturally conservative views became organized in trying to stop this transformation of American society.
Many of them became politically active and started voting for people like Richard Nixon in 1968, too based on a more conservative guy who tried to stop this transformation of the 1960s.
This Nixon continued, decided to double down on the war on Vietnam.
This turned out to be a rather unpopular move because the war became less and less popular, each day that went by.
And one of the things that made it unpopular is simply the fact that it wasn't working.
You know, in 1968 when Nixon was elected president, he rejected a deal by Vietnam to try to negotiate a peace deal for the US to get out of Vietnam.
And eventually, as it became clear that they could not win the war without just demolishing the whole country of Vietnam, Nixon ended up having to take that same deal that he had rejected in 1968, saying that he would be humiliating for the US to accept,
ended up taking that deal five years later after thousands and thousands of Americans as well as Vietnamese lives and billions of dollars spent.
So clearly the Vietnam War was not a success for the US foreign policy.
And Nixon himself will run into some trouble.
One of the big events is that in 1972 during the presidential election when Nixon will be re-elected, some guys were busted, put in microphones in a place where at the Watergate complex where
Democrats would meet to discuss their strategy for the 72 election.
Since there are only two parties in the US, you know, who's going to want to spy on Democrats, obviously going to be the other party.
So in what will become known as the Watergate scandal, the debate was where these guys just Republican sympathizers who did this illegal thing, or did Nixon and this campaign know about it, which would turn it into a much bigger deal because then the president would be
complicit in this.
Nixon denied any knowledge of this stuff, a foot, the investigation to turn nail, but two years into it, by 1974, it became clear that he had no one about it, and there was evidence for it.
So Nixon become the first president in US history having to resign because Eddie not done that, he would have been impeached the following day.
So he resigns from office first time ever.
And in many ways, this is part of a trend that we saw out of the Vietnam War was the first war that was so heavily criticized by large segments of the American population.
Nixon become the first president who's busted committing illegal activity and having to resign from office.
In some way that veil of illusion, that sense that the government is, you know, politicians have your best interest at art, the president in the United States is always a good guy.
And in many, many, many people in the US begin no longer to feel that way.
Largely as a result of the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal and so on and so forth.
And this trend towards seeing the politics as a poison as well of corruption really begin around this time and continue on down to this day.
So that the sense of disillusionment and cynicism that emerges in the 1970s will very much continue on down to present times.
Now, as I told you, we are now going to cover all the big events in US history.
I wanted to at least touch on a few big ones and so we're actually going to stop the chronological narration of the events with the 1970s.
You know, yeah, let's mention the fact that in the 1980s the Soviet Union collapses so the United States will end up winning the Cold War just because the economy of the Soviet Union could no longer keep up.
We're not going to get into all the details of what happens later, but I do want to make one point that carries over to the president and I sort of halfway made it already, but I want to reemphasize it.
This idea that the relationship of the American public with its government and its politicians has changed dramatically in the pre-1960s era and the post-1960s era.
In the pre-1960s you could have your political favorites, but ultimately you felt that the government was on your side.
In the post-1960s the majority of people no longer failed away, which is why you have seen even in presidential elections, even political experience become more of a handicap than an advantage.
In like for example when President Obama was elected he only had two years as a senator, which is a really small political experience.
When President Trump is elected he has zero political experience, he has no time in government whatsoever, and far from being a problem for both Obama and Trump, this is an advantage.
Because so many people are so turned off by politicians, they have seen enough evidence on the corruption and sort of under the table deals that characterize government.
The most people no longer trust professional politicians, and so this idea of the outsiders to politics, now never mind that neither of them are tram-worked through outsiders, but that's a whole different conversation.
But the perception that is better to go for an outsider than for an insider is definitely something that shapes the American political scenes from the 1960s, 1970s forward, and in that sense it very much still shaped it to this day.
Other thing I should mention probably the 9-11 attacks during President Bush tenure in office, when the attack on the Twin Towers on the pentagon, all of the biggest terrorists attack in US history, these will also have a big impact on the last almost two decades of American politics.
Well actually almost two decades is I'm recording it right now in 2019, I'm sure I'm going to use these lectures for a while, so it may be more than two decades, by the time we are busy, we are in a future incarnation of this course.
But what you see happening since then is, well even that will lead to some issues for American politics, because you'll see like American intervention in Afghanistan wasn't criticized that much, because the thing is that you're not going to be able to see the American politics.
The theory of the war in Afghanistan was that the US would have to go after being led and was responsible for 9-11, most people around the world were pretty much okay with it, they supported the US.
But when in 2003 the US got involved with a war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9-11, the perception around the world was that the US went from being the good guys were being attacked into being the aggressors,
and so much public sympathy sort of faded away as a result of the war in Iraq, which also has an impact on American politics for the last several years.
In any case, as I told you, we're just going to take a quick borrowed idea of these events.
We are, I wanted to highlight at least some key events from World War II to the basics of the Cold War, the changing of perception of American politics from the 60s and 70s forward.
I wanted to at least briefly discuss these events.
So having said all that, we are going to wrap up all the material for this course.
As usual, if you have any questions or you're interested in going deeper on some things that we barely touched on, by all means feel free to shoot me an email, I'll be more than glad to direct you to any resources I can think of, and feel free to shoot me an email for anything really.
Anything that I can help you with, I would be more than happy to do so.
So in light of all these, I will wish you a great day and we officially wrap things.
